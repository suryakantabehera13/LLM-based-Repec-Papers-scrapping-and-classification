,3rd Urban Economy Forum 2021:The Brampton Resolution,Urban Economy Forum 2021 UEF2021,The 3rd Urban Economy Forum is one of the world's most premier urban gatherings on sustainable urban economies and urban management. The collaborative approach for collective action taken by the organisation is integral to strengthen urban areas and working toward a more sustainable urban environment. Participation is a must for urban areas and empowering local communities can lead to greater and more equitable economic and social outcomes. Appropriate education is lacking in many urban areas. Governments must have processes in place that empower and create opportunities for communities where their voices are heard and contribute to decision making. Engaging communities should not be just another tokenism step in the process. The Forum also echoed the view that bringing people and opportunities closer together allows neighborhoods to flourish.,"urban economy, UEF 2021, urban development, urban finance, urban development and climate change, community participation., All these keywords",https://ideas.repec.org/p/ess/wpaper/id13172.html,http://www.esocialsciences.org/Download/repecDownload.aspx?fname=A202217204249_19.pdf&fcategory=Articles&AId=13172&fref=repec,RePEc:ess:wpaper:id:13172,"Urban Economy Forum 2021 UEF2021, 2022.

,Is India Creating Adequate Jobs Post 2000: Treading Through Employment Elasticity,"G.D Bino Paul, Muralidharan T","This paper looks into diverse databases to gauge if economic growth in India creates adequate volume of jobs since the year 2000. In our exercise, we use a popular index called employment elasticity. This indicator says to what extent the employment expands while the economy grows. First, gauging the employment elasticity, we provide a comparative picture of India and other BRICS countries during 2000-2017. Second, using the time series data for 2000 to 2016, we present the analysis pertinent to India, disaggregated for Industries. Finally, we examine the temporal change in employment elasticity with respect to the organised manufacturing in India during 2000-2014. In essence, the data conveys that India needs to create discernibly higher volume of jobs in response to the impending economic growth or find other avenues like Manpower exports or entrepreneurship growth. All three exercises concur with the conclusion that job creation in India needs a gearing up since proportionate expansion in employment is not even a fifth of expansion in value added in the economy. What makes this attempt distinct from the extant literature is that it uses more granular data with respect to the household and the enterprise, while it examines the indicator from the macro angle, as well.","employment, employment elasticity, jobs, manpower exports, entrepreneurship growth, household data, job creation, india, south Asia, All these keywords",https://ideas.repec.org/p/ess/wpaper/id13093.html,http://www.esocialsciences.org/Download/repecDownload.aspx?fname=A202062605047_19.pdf&fcategory=Articles&AId=13093&fref=repec,RePEc:ess:wpaper:id:13093,"G.D Bino Paul & Muralidharan T, 2020.

,The Covid-19 Lockdown in India: Gender and Caste Dimensions of the First Job Losses,Ashwini Deshpande,"Based on national-level panel data from Centre for Monitoring Indian Economy (CMIE)'s Consumer Pyramids Household Survey (CPHS) database, this paper investigates the first effects of Covid-19 induced lockdown on employment. Examining the employment status of 37,000 in- dividuals before and after the lockdown, we find that individuals were 12.8 percentage points less likely to be employed post-lockdown. On a pre-lockdown base of 38.9 percent employment, this translates into a 33 precent reduction in the likelihood of being employed. The decline in employment is not gender and caste neutral. Men are more likely to be employed overall, and drop in male employment is greater in absolute terms. However, women who were employed in the pre-lockdown phase were 23.5 percentage points less likely to be employed in the post- lockdown phase, compared to men. Male heads of household were 11.3 percentage points more likely to be employed post-lockdown, compared to female heads of household. Caste differences are not as sharp as gender differences, but the we find that lockdown affected employment of the disadvantaged caste groups relatively more adversely than the higher ranked group of castes.","Covid-19, Lockdown, Employment, Gender, Caste, India, pandemic, COVID, Covid, All these keywords",https://ideas.repec.org/p/ess/wpaper/id13085.html,http://www.esocialsciences.org/Download/repecDownload.aspx?fname=A2020691898_19.pdf&fcategory=Articles&AId=13085&fref=repec,RePEc:ess:wpaper:id:13085,"Ashwini Deshpande, 2020.

,"(In)Visibility, Care and Cultural Barriers: The Size and Shape of Women's Work in India",Ashwini Deshpande,"Based on primary data from a large household survey in seven districts in West Bengal in India, this paper analyses the reasons underlying low labor force participation of women. In particular, we try to disentangle the intertwined strands of choice, constraints posed by domestic work and care responsibilities, and the predominant understanding of cultural norms as factors explaining the low labor force participation as measured by involvement in paid work. We document the fuzziness of the boundary between domestic work and unpaid (and therefore invisible) economic work that leads to mis-measurement of women's work and suggest methods to improve measurement. We find that being primarily responsible for domestic chores lower the probability of ""working"" , after accounting for all the conventional factors. We also document how, for women, being out of paid work is not synonymous with care or domestic work, as they are involved in expenditure saving activities. We also find that religion and visible markers such as veiling are not significant determinants of the probability of working. Our data shows substantial unmet demand for work. Given that women are primarily responsible for domestic chores, we also document that women express a demand for work that would be compatible with household chores.

,Inequality in a Global Perspective,Ravi Kanbur,"The basic story of global inequality in the last three decades has been an overall decline, but one which is composed of quite intricate patterns. There has been a decline in between country inequality as China and India have grown relative to the US and other rich countries. This has been accompanied by an increase in within country inequality, but this is itself composed of rising inequality in some countries such as China, India and the US, and declining inequality in other countries, including large economies in Latin America. Section 2 of the paper will review these patterns, highlighting country diversity to make the central point that policy matters. Section 3 addresses a normative question""”what relative weight should be given to within country and between inequality in making an overall global assessment? This section will bring on board recent philosophical discourse, including on inequality of opportunity in a global frame.

Parameters considered are timeliness of the publication of daily reports, accessibility of reports, sufficiency of the report in terms of all details and language(s) in which reports are released. With the exception of Kerala, all other states were found lacking in one or more parameters. The data from the Ministry also lacks in some parameters, perhaps due to lack of submission from the states. Further, an attempt was made to understand as to why Kerala tested more than other states even though testing criteria followed were the same across the country. It is found that a more rigorous implementation of screening process, going beyond guidelines issued by the Ministry could be the reason behind higher testing levels than other states, especially during initial phase of the pandemic.

,"Covid-19 Crisis, Pandemic Resilience and Linkages to Land: An Exposition","Pranab R Choudhury, Ranjan K Ghosh, Sumita Sindhi","For a COVID-19 like pandemic, the Achilles heel is an unsuspecting villain - rapid and global land use changes. The way governments, businesses and communities see, relate to and use land, not only influences the outbreak but also determines their impact on humanity and development. Drawing upon empirical evidences from epidemiology and land governance, this article argues why the current situation implores the need to focus on the interaction between land use and global diseases. Apart from dwelling on causal links, we discuss the externalities that industrial, urban and rural development in India are poised to face because of the pandemic's potential impact on land, biodiversity and wildlife habitat, property rights and housing. We also underline reform options for policy and practice, that must be discussed and acted upon.","COVID-19, land use, global diseases, biodiversity, wildlife habitat, property rights, housing, India, South Asia, All these keywords",https://ideas.repec.org/p/ess/wpaper/id13058.html,http://www.esocialsciences.org/Download/repecDownload.aspx?fname=A2020512172459_19.pdf&fcategory=Articles&AId=13058&fref=repec,RePEc:ess:wpaper:id:13058,"Pranab R Choudhury & Ranjan K Ghosh & Sumita Sindhi, 2020.

This was an early attempt and gave somewhat tentative results. With some 7 more days of data being now available, better estimates are possible which we bring out in this paper. As in the previous paper we use a logistic model of cumulative cases and deaths, to estimate the zero growth level of cases and deaths. We also provide an upper bound to these estimates. The earlier estimates are further reinforced, and new estimates are made for a select set of countries where the growth rates in the numbers of cases, and in deaths have begun to decline.

Although risks remain they are of a lower order of magnitude compared to those in the pre global crisis period. But progress is slowest in areas of concern to EMs. Question marks over liquidity in markets as quantitative easing is withdrawn are echoed in EMs, which also face risk-off outflows and volatile exchange rates in this period. Leverage is high in some EMs after a period of low global interest rates and risk-on inflows in search of yields. But EMs are largely left to handle volatility themselves. Even the advice given to them or its understanding in policy circles or markets is not sufficiently nuanced. There are arguments for and against financial tightening as the best response to achieve financial stability. These are examined in the context of experiences in some specific EMs. Implications are drawn for G-20 policies and for its advice to EMs.","eSS, G-20, Financial reforms, Emerging markets, emerging markets (EMs), volatile exchange rates, pre global crisis period., All these keywords",https://ideas.repec.org/p/ess/wpaper/id13042.html,http://www.esocialsciences.org/Download/repecDownload.aspx?fname=A2019425114636_29.pdf&fcategory=Articles&AId=13042&fref=repec,RePEc:ess:wpaper:id:13042,"Ashima Goyal & Akhilesh Verma, 2019.

,"News, Noise and Indian Business Cycle","Ashima Goyal, Abhishek Kumar","New Keynesian Dynamic Stochastic General Equilibrium (DSGE) models with various specifications of technology, markup and interest rate shocks are estimated with Indian data using Kalman filter based pure and Bayesian likelihood estimation. Preference and interest rate shocks are found to be important for output determination whereas markup and interest rate shocks are important for inflation. News, such as contained in stock market variables and arising from anticipated interest rates, affects growth of gross domestic product. Interest rate shock is anticipated at horizon of one quarter and out of total variance explained by interest rate shock, one third is due to the anticipated shock. Anticipated interest rate shock diminishes the role of preference shock in output determination. Markup shock has a large share, very low persistence but is correlated. There is evidence that permanent component of technology is not well anticipated, and once we incorporate that technology shocks become more important for determination of output although it still remains much below US levels.

,New Technology and Emerging Occupations: Evidence from Asia,"Sameer Khatiwada, Mia Kim Maceda Veloso","This paper investigates the emergence of new occupations by comparing various classifications of occupations and predicting probabilities to access them given workers' characteristics. Systematic comparisons of successive lists of National Classification of Occupations in India, Malaysia, the Philippines, and Viet Nam find that most new job titles are primarily information and communication technology- and data-related positions within professional and associate professional occupational divisions. When utilizing microdata of India and Viet Nam, it was found that the emerging occupations, defined as occupation groups with new job titles, pay higher wages than none merging occupations. Further, when using logit models to predict chances of accessing emerging occupations given workers' characteristics, the probability of success is greater for workers who are male, tertiary educated, urbanized, and employed in the service sectors. Adjusted predictions by education and sector show that access to emerging occupations is highest among tertiary-educated workers in services, and that chances of success vary greatly across different age groups.","eSS, industries, innovation, new work, occupations, All these keywords",https://ideas.repec.org/p/ess/wpaper/id13039.html,http://www.esocialsciences.org/Download/repecDownload.aspx?fname=A20194249231_29.pdf&fcategory=Articles&AId=13039&fref=repec,RePEc:ess:wpaper:id:13039,"Sameer Khatiwada & Mia Kim Maceda Veloso, 2019.

,Adverse Selection and Credit Certificates: Evidence from a P2P Platform,"Maggie Rong Hu, Xiaoyang Li, Yang Shi","Certificates are widely used as a signaling mechanism to mitigate adverse selection when information is asymmetric. To reduce information asymmetry between lenders and borrowers, Chinese peer-to-peer (P2P) lending platforms encourage borrowers to obtain various kinds of credit certificates. As P2P markets continue to develop, it is plausible that certification may play a pivotal role in ensuring investment efficiency. It performs the first empirical investigation of this issue, using unique data from Renrendai, one of the People's Republic of China's largest P2P lending platforms. It finds that surprisingly, loans with more credit certificates experience a higher rate of delinquency and default. However, lenders remain attracted by higher certificates despite lower loan performance ex post, which results in distorted capital allocation and reduced investment inefficiency. Overall, the paper documents a setting where credit certificates fail to serve as an accurate signal due to their costless nature, where poor-quality borrowers use more certificates to boost their credit profiles and improve their funding success. Possible explanations for this phenomenon include differences in marginal benefit of certificates for different borrower types, bounded rationality, cognitive simplification, and borrower myopia.","eSS, P2P lending, credit allocation, adverse selection, certificate, bounded rationality, cognitive simplification, All these keywords",https://ideas.repec.org/p/ess/wpaper/id13038.html,http://www.esocialsciences.org/Download/repecDownload.aspx?fname=A201942491619_29.pdf&fcategory=Articles&AId=13038&fref=repec,RePEc:ess:wpaper:id:13038,"Maggie Rong Hu & Xiaoyang Li & Yang Shi, 2019.

With its flexibility and simplicity, P2PL reduces the gap in financing that cannot be fulfilled by banks. However, the rapid development of P2PL also raises a number of problems that burden users such as unethical debt collection methods, and the imposition of excessive interest rate and other costs that potentially threaten national financial system stability. Therefore, by utilizing big data, which in this case is 40,650 reviews from 110 P2PLs obtained from Google Play within the period of March 2016-August 2018, this research builds a big data-based P2PL surveillance system based on four aspects, namely legality, review rating, debt collection methods, and level of interest rates and other costs.","eSS, Peer-to-peer lending (P2PL), fintech, peer to peer lending, big data, review, Google Play, All these keywords",https://ideas.repec.org/p/ess/wpaper/id13037.html,http://www.esocialsciences.org/Download/repecDownload.aspx?fname=A2019423124231_29.pdf&fcategory=Articles&AId=13037&fref=repec,RePEc:ess:wpaper:id:13037,"Nika Pranata & Alan Ray Farandy, 2019.

,Macroprudential Policy in Asian Economies,Soyoung Kim,"This paper analyzes the conduct and effects of macroprudential policy in 11 Asian economies. Of these, India, the People's Republic of China, and the Republic of Korea frequently used loan-to-value ratios and required reserve ratios even before the global financial crisis. India and the People's Republic of China are the most frequent users of macroprudential policy tools. Since 2000, tightening actions have been more frequent than loosening in the 11 economies. Most took tightening actions more frequently after the global financial crisis than before it. In most of these economies, macroprudential policy tends to be tightened when credit expands. The main empirical results from the analysis, which uses panel vector autoregression models, are that contractionary macroprudential policy has significant negative effects on credit and output; and that these effects are qualitatively similar to those of monetary policy. This suggests that policy authorities may experience potential policy conflicts when credit conditions are excessive and the economy is in recession.","eSS, Macroprudential Policy, Asian Economies, People's Republic of China, macroprudential policy tools, global financial crisis., All these keywords",https://ideas.repec.org/p/ess/wpaper/id13036.html,http://www.esocialsciences.org/Download/repecDownload.aspx?fname=A2019423123735_29.pdf&fcategory=Articles&AId=13036&fref=repec,RePEc:ess:wpaper:id:13036,"Soyoung Kim, 2019.

Implementation of supportive policies for female-owned SMEs will have significant contribution to economic growth, employment, and ultimately, to gender equality. Within a patriarchal society, women are placed in a precarious societal positioning that leads to a prevalence of gender inequality in education, financial literacy, and access to finance. In the context of Asia, where small and medium-sized enterprises (SMEs) are the backbone of most Asian economies and the financial sector is dominated by banks, women in entrepreneurship are susceptible to facing greater credit constraints relative to their male counterparts, which can compromise their corporate performance.

,"Price Discovery in Indian Government Securities Market, Monetary Management and the Cost of Government Borrowing",Ashima Goyal,"Over 2017-18 there was a sharp rise in Indian government securities (G-Secs) interest rates unrelated to fundamentals. Examining each of the standard explanatory variables shows them to be inadequate to account for the rise in bond yields in this period. Turning to aspects of Indian structure the reason is found to be the narrow focus of monetary operating procedures, with excessive reliance on making up liquidity shortfalls with short-term liquidity, which was inadequate given large exogenous durable liquidity shocks including foreign inflows. The composition of liquidity, share of reserve money and its sources all matter. Open market operations (OMOs) have a significant impact on yields. Large foreign debt inflows induce OMOs sales as G-Secs are swapped for foreign securities to sterilize the effect of inflows on the money supply. G-Secs yields are then found to rise.","Ess, Government securities market, yields, open market operations, debt inflows, price discovery, Monetary Management, Cost of Government Borrowing, Open market operations (OMOs)., All these keywords",https://ideas.repec.org/p/ess/wpaper/id13027.html,http://www.esocialsciences.org/Download/repecDownload.aspx?fname=A2019329141342_29.pdf&fcategory=Articles&AId=13027&fref=repec,RePEc:ess:wpaper:id:13027,"Ashima Goyal, 2019.

,What Explains the Volatility of India's Catch-up Growth?,Ashima Goyal,"Indian post reform growth rates have been higher but more volatile compared to transition periods for other comparable countries. The reasons are aggravation of shocks due to unaddressed critical bottlenecks together with pro-cyclical macroeconomic policy that compressed aggregate demand. Reform is required to relieve constraints, but traditional reforms may be neither appropriate nor achievable. Feasible reforms are discussed. Since diversity and resilience has increased and some constraints have eased, the paper argues sustained high growth is reachable with the relevant policy support.","eSS, India, growth, volatility, resilience, reforms, shocks, pro-cyclical, All these keywords",https://ideas.repec.org/p/ess/wpaper/id13026.html,http://www.esocialsciences.org/Download/repecDownload.aspx?fname=A2019329131951_29.pdf&fcategory=Articles&AId=13026&fref=repec,RePEc:ess:wpaper:id:13026,"Ashima Goyal, 2019.

,India's Universal Basic Income: Bedeviled by the Details,Saksham Khosla,"The idea of a Universal Basic Income (UBI)-""”periodic and uncon- ditional cash payments to all citizens""”has gained renewed attention amid growing concerns about technological unemployment in advanced economies. More recently, economists have made the case for a UBI in the developing world, where cash transfers distributed to all citizens, rich and poor, may cut through layers of red tape and lead to outsize gains in poverty reduction. In India, a rapid expansion of direct cash transfers linked to the national biometric database and small basic income experiments have galvanized an extensive debate on a UBI. Supporters claim that no-strings-attached payments will be an effective antidote to India's underperforming antipoverty programs and leaky, distortionary subsidies. Critics worry that they will undermine an already-fragile social security architecture, cause workers to drop out of the labor force, and encourage wasteful spending.Rather than relying exclusively upon the survey's proposed methods for financing, targeting, and distributing a UBI, Indian policymakers should join their Finnish and Canadian counterparts in running one or several large-scale experimental evaluations. By determining the impact on both the government (state and fiscal capacity) and citizens (economic and social outcomes), such trials can generate new empirical evidence to inform the growing UBI debate and reveal the most effective role for unconditional transfers in India's welfare architecture.","UBI, Universal Basic Income, unconditional transfers, welfare architecture, anti-poverty programmes, social security architecture, All these keywords",https://ideas.repec.org/p/ess/wpaper/id13024.html,http://www.esocialsciences.org/Articles/show_Article.aspx?acat=InstitutionalPapers&aid=13024,RePEc:ess:wpaper:id:13024,"Saksham Khosla, 2019.

,Sectoral amd Skill Contributions to Labor Productivity in Asia,"Matthias Helble, Long Q Trinh, Trang Le","Using a decomposition approach on data collected by the Asian Productivity Organization (APO) as well as World Input-Output data, it shows that in most Asian economies the services sector makes the largest contribution to labor productivity. Furthermore, it finds evidence of a major reallocation of labor from agriculture directly to services, bypassing the manufacturing sector. This finding challenges the traditional view that countries in their economic development need to have their workforce employed first in manufacturing before switching to services. Lastly, the paper studies how different skill levels contribute to labor productivity growth. It finds that high-skilled workers have contributed most to overall labor productivity growth in developing Asia. In services, high-skilled workers have mainly driven labor productivity, indicating that upskilling and training are instrumental in services-led development.","eSS, labor productivity, manufacturing, services, skills, All these keywords",https://ideas.repec.org/p/ess/wpaper/id13015.html,http://www.esocialsciences.org/Download/repecDownload.aspx?fname=A2019312151738_29.pdf&fcategory=Articles&AId=13015&fref=repec,RePEc:ess:wpaper:id:13015,"Matthias Helble & Long Q Trinh & Trang Le, 2019.

,Private Hospitals in Health Insurance Network in India: A Reflection for Implementation of Ayushman Bharat,"Mita Choudhury, Pritam Datta","This paper examines the availability and spread of private hospitals in the country to provide insights on the potential access to insured health services in GSHIS schemes. It uses three sets of information to analyse the issue: private hospitals empanelled by insurance companies, the 6th Economic Census, and private hospitals empanelled in GSHIS schemes in four States. The analysis suggests that, in low-income States of the country, empanelment of private hospitals by insurance companies is low and concentrated in a few pockets. This pattern closely corresponds to the pattern of availability of private hospitals indicated in the 6th Economic Census. In Andhra Pradesh, Telangana, Tamil Nadu and Karnataka, the four States which have some of the largest GSHIS schemes in the country, there is a strong correspondence between private hospitals empanelled by insurance companies and private hospitals empanelled in GSHIS schemes. In these States, the extent of empanelment of private hospitals in GSHIS schemes is also substantially smaller than the empanelment of private hospitals by insurance companies. This may indicate differences in entry conditions or low willingness of private hospitals to participate in GSHIS schemes.","eSS, : Private health providers, Private hospitals, Ayushman Bharat, Pradhan Mantri Jan Arogya Yojana, Access to health care, India, All these keywords",https://ideas.repec.org/p/ess/wpaper/id13009.html,http://www.esocialsciences.org/Download/repecDownload.aspx?fname=A201922018530_29.pdf&fcategory=Articles&AId=13009&fref=repec,RePEc:ess:wpaper:id:13009,"Mita Choudhury & Pritam Datta, 2019.

Using the over-education/required education/undereducation (ORU) models on a cross section dataset of individuals employed (as a regular salaried/ wage employee or as casual wage labour) in India's T&C industry, it finds that the overall educational mismatch ratio during 2011-12 was to the tune of 67.61%. Further, results indicate that while returns to surplus education is positive, it is less in magnitude as compared to returns to required education, suggesting underutilization of excess education.

,The Growing Importance of Consumer Finance for Financial Inclusion in India,"Saon Ray, Smita Miglani, Sandeep Paul","This paper examines the role of consumer finance, a high growth segment of the Indian financial sector in promoting financial inclusion. Consumer finance involves granting credit to consumers to enable them to possess goods for everyday use. While the Indian financial sector is changing rapidly, a large number of households still rely on informal sources for unforeseen expenditure. The paper presents results of a survey of consumer perception on the role of consumer credit to financial inclusion. Financial inclusion or access to financial services is a major development goal for all nations across the globe. The concept has a multitude of dimensions from payments and savings accounts, credit, insurance and pensions and securities market. Ensuring quality access to formal financial services has always been a challenging task. Despite being a prime policy agenda for decades, the goal of universal financial inclusion is yet to be achieved in India. The Indian financial inclusion story so far was led by commercial banks and MFIs. While acknowledging the importance of access to credit for productive purposes, a total integration with financial market also means access to services like insurance and consumption loans.","eSS, financial inclusion, NBFCs, consumer survey, financial sector, consumer finance, credit to consumers, expenditure, consumer perception, financial services, savings accounts, credit, insurance, pensions, securities market, formal financial services, universal financial inclusion, consumption loans, India., All these keywords",https://ideas.repec.org/p/ess/wpaper/id13000.html,http://www.esocialsciences.org/Download/repecDownload.aspx?fname=A20192313914_29.pdf&fcategory=Articles&AId=13000&fref=repec,RePEc:ess:wpaper:id:13000,"Saon Ray & Smita Miglani & Sandeep Paul, 2019.

,The Anomaly of Women's Work and Education in India,Surbhi Ghai,"This paper utilizes a large cross-section of data sets such as the ILOSTAT, NSSO Quinquennial Employment and Unemployment Survey, Labour Bureau Annual Employment and Unemployment Survey, National Family Health Survey and CMIE Consumer Pyramid Household Survey to comment on the falling female labour force participation rates in India. It is found that not only has there been a fall in the female labour force participation rates, but the size of the total female labour force has also shrunk in recent years. Besides presenting a series of demand and supply side factors that might possibly explain this trend, it aims to look at it particularly in conjunction with education and provide a commentary on the same. It is proposed that prevailing social norms and patriarchy hinders the participation of women in the economy despite high levels of education. Bivariate and multivariate analyses is conducted on state level cross-sectional data and it is found that patriarchy is indicative of the large proportion of women out of the labour force at high levels of education. It is concluded that education in the current form alone might not be sufficient to spur growth in female labour force participation rates in India. Government schemes must target the fundamental cultural and social forces that shape patriarchy. These coupled with policies that simultaneously address some of the other demand and supply side constraints will go a long way in bolstering the participation of women in the economy.","eSS, Female Labour Force Participation Rate, Education, Patriarchy, ILOSTAT, NSSO Quinquennial Employment and Unemployment Survey, Labour Bureau Annual Employment, Unemployment Survey, National Family Health Survey, CMIE Consumer Pyramid Household Survey, female labour force, labour force participation, female labour force participation rates, education, social norms, Government schemes, cultural forces, social forces, economy, India., All these keywords",https://ideas.repec.org/p/ess/wpaper/id12999.html,http://www.esocialsciences.org/Download/repecDownload.aspx?fname=A20192313030_29.pdf&fcategory=Articles&AId=12999&fref=repec,RePEc:ess:wpaper:id:12999,"Surbhi Ghai, 2019.

,Explaining the contractualisation of India's workforce,"Radhicka Kapoor, P. P. Krishnapriya","The employment structure of India's organised manufacturing sector has undergone substantial changes over the last decade with a steep rise in the use of contract workers in place of directly hired workers. Much of the existing literature has attributed the widespread use of contract labour to India's rigid employment protection legislation. Using plant level data from the Annual Survey of Industries, it finds that in addition to labour market rigidities and the existence of a wage differential between contract and directly hired workers, firms in the organised manufacturing sector have another important incentive to hire contract workers. Firms appear to be using contract workers to their strategic advantage against unionized directly hired workers to keep their bargaining power and wage demand in check. Importantly, the strength of this bargaining channel varies across firms depending on their capital intensity of production, size and existing contract worker intensity.","eSS, employment, wages, labour contracts, collective bargaining, labour productivity, employment structure, contract workers, hired workers, employment protection legislation, Annual Survey of Industries, labour market, wage differential, manufacturing sector, incentives, bargaining power, wage demand, bargaining channel, capital intensity of production, India., All these keywords",https://ideas.repec.org/p/ess/wpaper/id12998.html,http://www.esocialsciences.org/Download/repecDownload.aspx?fname=A201923125339_29.pdf&fcategory=Articles&AId=12998&fref=repec,RePEc:ess:wpaper:id:12998,"Radhicka Kapoor & P.

,Is There a Demand for Reverse Mortgages in China? Evidence from Two Online Surveys,"Katja Hanewald, Hazel Bateman, Hanming Fang, Shang Wu","Reverse mortgages provide an alternative source of retirement funding by allowing older homeowners to borrow against their home. However, a recent pilot program of reserve mortgage products in several large Chinese cities saw almost no take up. To ascertain the demand for reverse mortgages in China, a survey was conducted and analysed two online surveys that focus respectively on homeowners aged 45-65 as potential purchasers, and on adult children in the 20-49 age group representing children of potential purchasers. It addressed the reported shortcomings of the pilot reverse mortgage product by testing an improved product design presented in a clear and comprehensive format. In stark contrast, It was found that 89% of older Chinese homeowners would be interested in this new reverse mortgage product, and 84% of adult children would recommend such a product to their parents. Participants in both surveys reported that they would use the reverse mortgage payments to fund a more comfortable retirement and to pay for better medical treatments and aged care services. Respondents' interest in reverse mortgages was associated with their familiarity and understanding of the product, and its perceived potential to address liquidity constraints in retirement. Health status, aged care preferences and proxies for intergenerational links were also important. The results are contrary to the common perception of intergenerational expectations of wealth transfer in China, and provide new evidence in support of the potential development of China's reverse mortgage market.","eSS, demand, Reverse Mortgages, retirement funding, homeowners, borrow, reserve mortgage products, potential purchasers, mortgage payments, health status, aged care preferences, intergenerational expectations, wealth transfer, potential development, mortgage market, China., All these keywords",https://ideas.repec.org/p/ess/wpaper/id12997.html,http://www.esocialsciences.org/Download/repecDownload.aspx?fname=A201923124544_29.pdf&fcategory=Articles&AId=12997&fref=repec,RePEc:ess:wpaper:id:12997,"Katja Hanewald & Hazel Bateman & Hanming Fang & Shang Wu, 2019.

Jose,"The study attempts a comparative assessment of the changing employment situation in major Indian states, measured in terms of worker-population ratios and the distribution of workers into status groups, gender categories and industrial divisions. The change is seen as part of a transformative process, when labour markets mature into organized entities, based in urban areas and governed by civic authorities. Such transformation leads to an increase of non-agricultural employment, measured using two criteria: (i) rising share of formal employment and (ii) consistent increase of women in paid employment.

As economic activities of those firms in the respective host countries are not accessible, the present study is restricted to analyse the push and pull factors, based on the macroeconomic indicators of the leading nineteen countries that hosted such investments between 2004 and 2015. The study employs Negative binomial and Ordinary Least Square (OLS) panel data regression.

The analytical framework employs a standard oligopolistic strategic trade model in a three-country world. In presence of technology asymmetry, there will exist a clash of interest between the FTA members while the non-member will always prefer to join the bloc.

,Globalization and the Re-Articulations of the Local: A Case Study from Kerala's Midlands,Mijo Luke,"This paper is a preliminary attempt to understand globalisation and social transformation in the rural Kerala. It addresses the socioeconomic changes in a village in the mid-land region of Kerala namely Kavakad, by looking at the historical shaping of the determinants of change. The paper triangulates quantitative data and qualitative materials from fieldwork alongside the historical sources to understand social transformation. It focuses on the historical trajectories of mobility (spatial, educational, and occupational) of three communities in the village, namely Syrian Christian, Ezhava and Pulaya. The shaping of the locality and development trajectory is entrenched in the power dynamics of land ownership between the Pulaya and Syrian Christian communities, which facilitated Syrian Christian dominance in the development process, and hence, the community appeared to be the locus of 20th-century socio-economic transition in the village.","eSS, Globalisation, Communities, Shaping of the local, Social inequalities, Market versus Political, mid-land region, quantitative data, qualitative materials, historical trajectories, mobility, Kerala, India., All these keywords",https://ideas.repec.org/p/ess/wpaper/id12991.html,http://www.esocialsciences.org/Download/repecDownload.aspx?fname=A2019131121511_29.pdf&fcategory=Articles&AId=12991&fref=repec,RePEc:ess:wpaper:id:12991,"Mijo Luke, 2019.

Kannan,This paper examines the dimension of inequality since our earlier work on poverty and deprivation suggest that social inequality seems to overwhelm all other inequalities in a whole range of indicators. The period of analysis is between 1993 and 2012. The findings suggest that overall wage inequality increased during the first decade (1993-2005) of economic reforms and declined somewhat during the next decade (2004-2012). More detailed work shows that the decline is mostly in the bottom half of the wage worker population.

,"Multi- Product Firms, Tariff Liberalization and Product Churning in Vietnamese Manufacturing",Ha Thi Thanh Doan,"This study documents the frequency and characteristics of multi-product firms in Vietnamese manufacturing. The major findings are as follows. First, multi-product firms are larger, more capital-intensive, more productive, and are more likely to export. Second, multi-product firms are active in the market. Approximately 60% of firms adjust their product scope within a 6-year period. Third, the contribution of firms' product extensive margin to aggregate output growth is limited due to the prevalence of product dropping, which offsets the positive impact of product adding. Most output growth during the period is thus generated by the intensive margin. Turning to the link between tariff reduction and product shedding, it does not detect any significant impact. However, it finds that exporters play an important role in product adding, which suggests that they may contribute to aggregate growth through the channeling of product scope expansion. Contrary to the expectations, the analysis offers limited support for the heterogeneity of product turnover across ownership types. While it finds that state-owned enterprises are more likely to spread economic activities across products and industries, there is little difference in terms of product churning amongst foreign direct investment, state-owned enterprises, and the domestic private sector.","eSS, multi-product firms, trade liberalization, tariff liberalization, manufacturing, capital- intensive, export, ownership, enterprises, economic activities, industries, foreign direct investment, state-owned enterprises, domestic private sector., All these keywords",https://ideas.repec.org/p/ess/wpaper/id12984.html,http://www.esocialsciences.org/Download/repecDownload.aspx?fname=A201912912517_29.pdf&fcategory=Articles&AId=12984&fref=repec,RePEc:ess:wpaper:id:12984,"Ha Thi Thanh Doan, 2019.

,Why is Green Finance Important ?,"Jeffrey D.

This could threaten the expansion of green energy needed to provide energy security and meet climate and clean air goals. Several developed and developing economies are still following pro-coal energy policies and the extra CO2 generated by new coal-fired power plants could more than wipe out any reductions in emissions made by other nations. Finance is the engine of development of infrastructure projects, including energy projects. Generally financial institutions show more interest in fossil fuel projects than green projects, mainly because there are still several risks associated with these new technologies and they offer a lower rate of return. If they want to achieve sustainable development goals, they need to open a new file for green projects and scale up the financing of investments that provide environmental benefits, through new financial instruments and new policies, such as green bonds, green banks, carbon market instruments, fiscal policy, green central banking, financial technologies, community-based green funds, etc., which are collectively known as ""green finance"" .","eSS, green finance, renewable energy, CO2 emissions, Paris Agreement, sustainable development goals, SDGs, All these keywords",https://ideas.repec.org/p/ess/wpaper/id12983.html,http://www.esocialsciences.org/Download/repecDownload.aspx?fname=A2019128154737_29.pdf&fcategory=Articles&AId=12983&fref=repec,RePEc:ess:wpaper:id:12983,"Jeffrey D.

A Structural VAR Approach,"Ranjan Kumar Mohanty, Sidheswar Panda","This study investigates the macroeconomic effects of public debt in India using a Structural Vector Auto regression (SVAR) framework for the period from 1980 to 2017. The objective of this study is to examine the impact of several types of public debt on economic growth, investment, interest rate and inflation in India. The results of the Impulse response functions show that public debt has an adverse impact on economic growth, a positive impact on long-term interest rate and a mixed response (both negative and positive) on investment and inflation in India. It is also found that the domestic debt has a more adverse impact on the economy than external debt in India. The estimated variance decomposition analysis shows that much of the variations among selected macro variables are explained by public debt and growth in India. The study suggests that public debt, especially the domestic debt should be controlled and used in a more productive manner in order to have a favourable impact on the economy.","eSS, Public Debt, Internal Debt, External Debt, Economic Growth, Structural VAR Approach, Structural Vector Auto regression (SVAR), economic growth, interest rate, inflation, India, All these keywords",https://ideas.repec.org/p/ess/wpaper/id12980.html,http://www.esocialsciences.org/Download/repecDownload.aspx?fname=A201912315745_29.pdf&fcategory=Articles&AId=12980&fref=repec,RePEc:ess:wpaper:id:12980,"Ranjan Kumar Mohanty & Sidheswar Panda, 2019.

Post the global financial crisis, there is a growing debate on whether monetary policy should target financial stability. Using India as a case study, it presents an empirical approach to assess whether monetary policy can target financial stability. This is done by examining the trade-off between price and financial stability for India. Using correlation between price and financial cycles, it finds that a trade-off exists between price and financial stability. The findings is robust to a series of robustness checks. The study has implications for the conduct of monetary policy in emerging economies.

This paper takes a statistical approach to understand the extent of changes in primary economic activity of Â¬firms over time and across different industries. It uses the history of economic activity of over 46000 Â¬firms spread over 25 years from CMIE Prowess to identify the number of times Â¬firms change the nature of their business. Using the count of changes, it estimates Poisson and Negative Binomial regression models to gain predictability over changing economic activity across industry groups. The paper shows that a Poisson model accurately characterizes the distribution of count of changes across industries and that Â¬firms with a long history are more likely to have changed their primary economic activity over the years. Findings show that classification can be a crucial problem in a large dataset like the MCA21 and can even lead to distortions in value addition estimates at the industry level.","eSS, : Economic Activity, Manufacturing, India, Poisson Distribution, statistical approach, Poisson and Negative Binomial regression models, Poisson model, value addition, industry., All these keywords",https://ideas.repec.org/p/ess/wpaper/id12978.html,http://www.esocialsciences.org/Download/repecDownload.aspx?fname=A2019123145343_29.pdf&fcategory=Articles&AId=12978&fref=repec,RePEc:ess:wpaper:id:12978,"Radhika Pandey & Amey Sapre & Pramod Sinha, 2019.

,Responses to Trade Opening: Evidence and Lessons from Asia,Devashish Mitra,"In various Asian countries, international trade has raised productivity, lowered mark ups through import competition (while increasing them through cheaper inputs that can be imported), raised wages, expanded employment, and, above all, reduced poverty. This is in sharp contrast to the impact of trade in some of the Latin American countries, which suggests exercising caution in extrapolating results to Asian countries that have not yet been studied. There are also a few adverse consequences of trade that already been found for Asia.

Additionally, there are the adverse effects stemming from trade adjustment as a result of worker mobility costs.

,Green Finance in Singapore: Barriers and Solutions,Youngho Chang,"This study reviews how green finance in Singapore is working, examines existing barriers, and suggests some solutions. Singapore, a well-established financial hub in Asia, aims to be a hub for green finance in Asia. The Monetary Authority of Singapore (MAS), the central bank of Singapore, has formed a network with seven other central banks in the world called the Central Banks and Supervisors Network for Greening Financial System, which intends to promote sharing of experience and best practices in green finance with other countries. Along with forming the network, the MAS has established a Green Bond Grant scheme to promote and ensure the issuance of green bonds in Singapore. In parallel, the Association of Banks in Singapore published Guidelines on Responsible Financing to promote and support environmental, social, and governance (ESG) disclosures. The Singapore Exchange asks its member firms to strictly comply with the ESG disclosures. At an individual firm level in Singapore, City Development Limited (CDL), a real estate development company, and Development Bank of Singapore Limited (DBS), a commercial bank, issued Singapore's first and second green bonds in 2017. The proceeds of the CDL green bond are allocated to finance retrofitting and upgrading of a commercial building in Singapore, while the proceeds of the DBS green bond are to be invested in renewable energy and climate change adaptation, among other uses. How successful the two green bonds are in meeting their pronounced goals and how well and effectively they contribute to the diffusion of renewable energy remains to be seen.","eSS, green finance, green bond grant scheme, guidelines of responsible financing, CDL green bond, DBS green bond, All these keywords",https://ideas.repec.org/p/ess/wpaper/id12974.html,http://www.esocialsciences.org/Download/repecDownload.aspx?fname=A2019120112344_29.pdf&fcategory=Articles&AId=12974&fref=repec,RePEc:ess:wpaper:id:12974,"Youngho Chang, 2019.

,The Development of Education and Health Services in Asia and the Role of the State,Sudipto Mundle,"This paper analyses the dramatic spread of education and healthcare in Asia and also the large variations in that spread across and within countries over fifty years. Apart from differences in initial conditions and income levels, the nature of the State has also been an important determinant of these variations. This is because social development has typically been led by the State. But in most countries, public resource constraints and the growing dependence on private provision and private spending have generated a pattern of nested disparities in the access to education and healthcare between rich and poor regions, between rural and urban areas within regions, and between rich and poor households within these areas. However, as the better-off regions, areas, and households approach the upper limits of achievable education and health standards, a process of convergence is also underway as those left behind begin to catch up.","eSS, Asia, comparative studies, disparity, education, health, institutions, State, development of education, health services., All these keywords",https://ideas.repec.org/p/ess/wpaper/id12973.html,http://www.esocialsciences.org/Download/repecDownload.aspx?fname=A201911412458_29.pdf&fcategory=Articles&AId=12973&fref=repec,RePEc:ess:wpaper:id:12973,"Sudipto Mundle, 2019.

,Impact of Intergovernmental Fiscal Transfers on Gender Equality in India: An Empirical Analysis,"Janet G. Stotsky, Lekha Chakraborty, Piyush Gandhi","Intergovernmental fiscal transfers (IGFT) are, in theory, neither good nor bad for tackling gender inequalities. Fiscal federalism with asymmetry in revenue and expenditure assignments inevitably leads to vertical and horizontal imbalances in public service provisioning. Intergovernmental transfers can play a role in equalization of fiscal capacities because the states of India have different tax raising capacities and capacities for funding public expenditure. Do higher per capita fiscal transfers help in reducing gender inequalities across states in India? Using data from the Finance Accounts of various states, the paper analyses the impact of fiscal transfers - both conditional and unconditional fiscal transfers - on the gender parity index in education, using panel data models. It finds that unconditional transfers have a significant and positive impact on gender parity outcomes in the education sector at the primary and secondary levels, in contrast to tied transfers. The models also control for gender budgeting initiatives across states and find that gender budgeting has a beneficial effect on education equality. The policy implication of these results for the recently constituted Fifteenth Finance Commission in India is to strengthen the ""gender equality"" criteria in intergovernmental transfers in India.","eSS, Intergovernmental fiscal transfers (IGFT), gender inequalities, fiscal federalism, expenditure, public service, fiscal capacities, tax, public expenditure, per capita fiscal transfers, gender parity index, education, education sector, primary level, secondary level, gender budgeting, Fifteenth Finance Commission in India, India., All these keywords",https://ideas.repec.org/p/ess/wpaper/id12972.html,http://www.esocialsciences.org/Download/repecDownload.aspx?fname=A201911412422_29.pdf&fcategory=Articles&AId=12972&fref=repec,RePEc:ess:wpaper:id:12972,"Janet G.

,Exporting and Firm Performance: Evidence from India,"Apoorva Gupta, Ila Patnaik, Ajay Shah","In this paper the positive correlation between firm productivity and export status is well established. This correlation can arise from multiple alternative casual models. It has investigated these relationships, harnessing the transition of several firms from serving the domestic market to exporting, in a dataset of Indian firms from 1989 to 2015. Each firm which made the transition is matched against a control which did not. The transitions take place across many years, thus permitting a matched event study in firm outcomes. The paper finds there is self-selection of more productive firms into exporting. Firms that make the transition become bigger, but there is little evidence of learning by exporting, of improvements in productivity right after exporting commences. However, there is evidence of improvement in productivity of export starters a couple of years before they begin to export.","eSS, export, firms, firm productivity, export status, casual models, domestic markets, dataset, productive firms, domestic market, transition, India., All these keywords",https://ideas.repec.org/p/ess/wpaper/id12969.html,http://www.esocialsciences.org/Download/repecDownload.aspx?fname=A2019112121938_29.pdf&fcategory=Articles&AId=12969&fref=repec,RePEc:ess:wpaper:id:12969,"Apoorva Gupta & Ila Patnaik & Ajay Shah, 2019.

,UDAY Power Debt in Retrospect and Prospects: Analyzing the Efficiency Parameters,"Amandeep Kaur, Lekha Chakraborty","The Government of India launched the Ujwal DISCOM Assurance Yojana (UDAY), in November 2015, with an objective of ""Power for All"" . Under the UDAY scheme, selected States agreed to convert 75 per cent of the DISCOM's (State Power Distribution Companies) power debt into State government non-SLR bonds, priced at not more than 75 basis points above the prevailing cut-off yield rate of government security of 10-year maturity. At aggregate level, so far, around 86 per cent of UDAY bonds have been issued - Rs. 2.32 lakh crores out of Rs. 2.69 lakh crores - across all UDAY States/UTs. Our estimates reveal that the financial and operational efficiency parameters envisaged in UDAY tripartite MoUs - between DISCOMs, the State Governments and the Ministry of Power, Government of India - have not been met by many States. Using UDAY portal data, we find that the average AT&C (Aggregate Technical and Commercial) losses that should have been 15% for all the participating states by 2018-19, presently, on average, stand at 25.41%. Yet another financial indicator, ACS-ARR gap (the gap between Average Cost and Average Revenue) has also widened for many UDAY participating states. The power tariff revisions have also not been implemented in the States -due to political economy reasons - and the operational parameters in our analysis indicate widening inefficiencies across States in power infrastructure.","eSS, Power infrastructure, Power Debt, Bonds, Financial efficiency, Ujwal DISCOM Assurance Yojana (UDAY), DISCOM's (State Power Distribution Companies), power debt, government security, power infrastructure., All these keywords",https://ideas.repec.org/p/ess/wpaper/id12968.html,http://www.esocialsciences.org/Download/repecDownload.aspx?fname=A201911113728_29.pdf&fcategory=Articles&AId=12968&fref=repec,RePEc:ess:wpaper:id:12968,"Amandeep Kaur & Lekha Chakraborty, 2019.

,"Analyzing the Dynamic Relationship between Physical Infrastructure, Financial Development and Economic Growth in India","Ranjan Kumar Mohanty, N. R. Bhanumurthy","The paper investigates dynamic relationship between physical infrastructure, financial development and economic growth in the case of India, using an Autoregressive Distributed Lag (ARDL) and Toda-Yamamoto (T-Y) causality approach for the period 1980 to 2016. Physical infrastructure index and financial development index are constructed using Principal Component Analysis method. Empirical results suggest that physical infrastructure has a positive effect on economic growth both in the long-run and short-run, whereas financial development, though significant, has a weak impact on economic growth. The causality test supports a bi-directional causal relationship between infrastructure development and economic growth, while it finds a unidirectional causation running from economic growth to financial development. It also finds that gross investment and employment have a positive, and inflation has an adverse effect on economic growth. As India is aiming for higher growth for a sustained period, our results suggest that there is a need for Government intervention in expanding the physical infrastructure and this, in turn, could lead to the growth of the financial sector in the country.","eSS, financial sector, Infrastructure Index, Financial Development Index, Economic Growth, ARDL Approach, India, All these keywords",https://ideas.repec.org/p/ess/wpaper/id12967.html,http://www.esocialsciences.org/Download/repecDownload.aspx?fname=A201911112492_29.pdf&fcategory=Articles&AId=12967&fref=repec,RePEc:ess:wpaper:id:12967,"Ranjan Kumar Mohanty & N.

,Optimal Regulation of P2P Lending for Small and Medium-Sized Enterprises,"Naoko Nemoto, Bihong Huang, David Storey","This paper describes and evaluates the range of P2P lending systems on offer to small and medium-sized enterprises (SMEs) in several countries, considering different regulatory regimes. In some countries, there are problematic incentives for platforms that rate credit and originate loans without holding the risk of these loans. In addition, when investor returns are guaranteed by platforms, investors have no incentive to distinguish among risk categories. In several countries, notably the People's Republic of China, P2P platforms have engaged in fraudulent behavior and Ponzi-like schemes. On the other hand, stringent regulation in the United States has excessively impeded new entrants from providing competition to established platforms. Regulators should be mindful of these risks and others, while also seeking to capitalize on the benefits that the sector offers for providing new funding opportunities to SMEs. In our view, the United Kingdom can be suggested as an effective model to follow because of its tailor made and flexible regulation.","eSS, fintech, P2P lending, regulation, P2P lending system, small and medium-sized enterprises (SMEs), incentives, loans, credit, investors, People's Republic of China, P2P platform, Ponzi-like schemes, global trend., All these keywords",https://ideas.repec.org/p/ess/wpaper/id12964.html,http://www.esocialsciences.org/Download/repecDownload.aspx?fname=A201917142550_29.pdf&fcategory=Articles&AId=12964&fref=repec,RePEc:ess:wpaper:id:12964,"Naoko Nemoto & Bihong Huang & David Storey, 2019.

,Marketing: The Crucial Success Factor for Pakistan's Credit Guarantee Scheme,"Talha Nadeem, Raheel Rasool","This paper, confines the focus to a discussion of how inadequate marketing diluted the scheme's impact. Specifically, several commercial banks could not tailor elements of their marketing mix""”including people, products, processes, and promotions""”to take full advantage of the scheme. That said, periodic revisions of the scheme helped to address some of its shortcomings, while the expectation is that other indicators will improve due to the recent changes in the scheme's parameters. The key finding is that policy makers can maximize the impact of a credit guarantee scheme by paying attention to the marketing mix, which sets up participating financial institutions for success (or failure) during the implementation phase. In addition, the scheme's structure should be a long-term intervention and its intended duration should be clear at the outset so that the participating financial institutions are motivated to design and roll out specialized products that tap the full potential of credit guarantees. Furthermore, the scheme's originators should be prepared to develop the entire ecosystem, which may include some initial hand holding of SMEs.","eSS, Pakistan's Credit Guarantee Scheme, Asian economies, SMEs, financing, credit guarantee, All these keywords",https://ideas.repec.org/p/ess/wpaper/id12962.html,http://www.esocialsciences.org/Download/repecDownload.aspx?fname=A20191323124_29.pdf&fcategory=Articles&AId=12962&fref=repec,RePEc:ess:wpaper:id:12962,"Talha Nadeem & Raheel Rasool, 2019.

The paper has also did not observe impacts on self-reported study habits. Several features of Zimba District that are likely to exist in other developing regions appear to drive our results. First, flashlights are the dominant lighting source in rural Zambia rather than traditional options like kerosene lamps or candles. In such environments, solar lights may hold only limited appeal for prospective users. Second, the survey data suggests that other major barriers to educational attainment likely render improved energy access (whether through solar lanterns or otherwise) a relatively unimportant educational input.","eSS, solar lanterns, rural, sub-Saharan Africa, power analysis, national examination, study habits, kerosene lamps, candles, solar lights, flashlights, All these keywords",https://ideas.repec.org/p/ess/wpaper/id12961.html,http://www.esocialsciences.org/Download/repecDownload.aspx?fname=A201913225458_29.pdf&fcategory=Articles&AId=12961&fref=repec,RePEc:ess:wpaper:id:12961,"Ognen Stojanovski & Mark Thurber & George Muwowo & Frank A.

,"Industrialization of Developing Countries in a Multicountry, Multisector Capital Accumulation Model",Tadateru Hayashi,"This paper shows that industrialization of developing countries, defined as start of production of investment goods, happens when their share in global production exceeds the global demand for consumption goods. Industrialization is simulated in a capital accumulation model with two countries (advanced and developing), three goods, and two factors. The model accommodates trade relations where countries specialize in the production of one or two goods, which happens when countries have relatively different factor endowments. The model includes production under monopolistic competition and with intermediate inputs. Capital mobility across the border can facilitate industrialization, but the developing country continues borrowing capital from the advanced country at the steady state where capital accumulation stops. The model also shows that a gap in per labor capital between countries narrows, but the developing country never catches up with the advanced country.

,The Role of SMEs in Asia and Their Difficulties in Accessing Finance,"Naoyuki Yoshino, Farhad Taghizadeh-Hesary","Small and medium-sized enterprises (SMEs) are the backbone of the Asian economy. They make up more than 96% of all Asian businesses, providing two out of three private-sector jobs on the continent. Therefore, it is vital for Asian economies' economic success that they have fully functioning support measures for SMEs. However, SMEs face major challenges in accessing cheap finance, mainly because of the asymmetric information problem between suppliers and demanders of funds and the high transaction costs. These lead to more collateral requirements for lending to SMEs with higher lending interest rates, which hinder their growth. As most Asian countries are bank-dominant economies, capital market financing is not a realistic option for SMEs. Therefore, we need to look for solutions that make the bank lending to SMEs easier. This study will highlight the difficulties of SMEs in accessing finance and provide measures for mitigating them. The remedies proposed in this paper are the development of credit information infrastructures for SMEs and the utilization of credit-rating techniques for SMEs to address the asymmetric information problem and the development of a sustainable credit guarantee scheme to solve the collateral issue of the SMEs and ease their assess to finance.","eSS, SME, credit rating, credit risk database, credit guarantee scheme, All these keywords",https://ideas.repec.org/p/ess/wpaper/id12959.html,http://www.esocialsciences.org/Download/repecDownload.aspx?fname=A201912133929_29.pdf&fcategory=Articles&AId=12959&fref=repec,RePEc:ess:wpaper:id:12959,"Naoyuki Yoshino & Farhad Taghizadeh-Hesary, 2019.

Whereas the previous literature has focused on indirect effects of policies""”flowing through productivity effects in domestic services markets""”the paper looks at direct effects, namely the ability of domestic manufacturers to access services inputs on world markets at competitive prices. The results show that discriminatory barriers to services trade have a significant negative effect on manufacturing exports. It uses theory-consistent counterfactual simulations to show that the trade and real output effects of a 10% reduction in services trade restrictiveness are in fact much larger than those of a 10% reduction in tariffs. On a policy level, the results suggest that an additional argument for liberalizing services markets is that it in fact aids manufacturing sector development, due to the intimate links between the two.","eSS, services, manufacturing, gravity model, services policies, productivity, domestic services markets, competitive prices, theory-consistent counterfactual simulations, trade, tariffs, liberalizing services markets, manufacturing sector., All these keywords",https://ideas.repec.org/p/ess/wpaper/id12958.html,http://www.esocialsciences.org/Download/repecDownload.aspx?fname=A2018122816055_29.pdf&fcategory=Articles&AId=12958&fref=repec,RePEc:ess:wpaper:id:12958,"Ben Shepherd, 2018.

,The Servicification of Manufacturing in Asia: Redefining the Sources of Labor Productivity,"Valerie Mercer-Blackman, Christine Ablaza","Services are playing an increasingly important role in the global economy. Over the last few decades, the sector's contribution to output, employment, and value-added trade has grown quite dramatically. The rise of services and apparent decline of manufacturing employment have raised concerns about the future of growth given the lower labor productivity of the former. But more recent studies have argued against this for several reasons. Among others, current measures of productivity do not properly account for the indirect contribution of services to other sectors. For example, the additional value generated by services in the production of manufactured goods can be substantial, but it is not properly accounted for because of the indivisible and intangible nature of services. Moreover, the rise of the digital economy has created new ways for services to contribute to production. This paper aims to tackle some of these issues by focusing on the servicification of manufacturing in Asia. Our contribution to the emerging literature is twofold. First, we propose a conceptual framework of servicification. And second, we offer some preliminary evidence of this phenomenon for Asia and measurement proposals to disentangle the contribution of services to labor productivity.","eSS, servicification, premature deindustrialization, labor productivity, manufacturing, time use surveys, global value chains, All these keywords",https://ideas.repec.org/p/ess/wpaper/id12954.html,http://www.esocialsciences.org/Download/repecDownload.aspx?fname=A20181221163248_29.pdf&fcategory=Articles&AId=12954&fref=repec,RePEc:ess:wpaper:id:12954,"Valerie Mercer-Blackman & Christine Ablaza, 2018.

The analysis estimates the direct impact on all tariff-affected goods; uses input-output analysis to estimate indirect effects on gross domestic product (GDP), exports, and employment; and allows for redirection of trade toward other producers using the approach of Feenstra and Sasahara (2017). A full escalation of the bilateral United States (US)-People's Republic of China (PRC) trade conflict would shave 1% off PRC GDP and 0.2% off US GDP.

,Does the Exposure to Routinization Explain the Evolution of the Labour Share of Income ? Evidence from Asia,Mitali Das,"This paper analyzes the evolution of the labor share of income in Asia, a region where countries have experienced steep declines and increases as well as stable labor income shares in the quarter-century since 1990. An innovation of this study is to expand the standard drivers of labor shares""”technological advance, trade, institutions, and policies""”by considering whether the exposure to routine jobs has also played a role in the evolution of the labor share of income. The more exposed a country is to routinization, the greater is the probability that ICT capital substitutes mid-skilled jobs, lowering the overall wage share of workers. Using a new dataset on the exposure to routinization, the study finds that it is an important determinant of the evolution of labor shares in developed Asian economies where the initial exposure was high but not in developing Asian economies where the share of routine jobs was small.","eSS, labour share, income, stable labour income, technological advance, trade, institutions, policies, standard drivers of labours share, innovation, routine jobs, evolution, ICT capital, mid- skilled jobs, Asia, All these keywords",https://ideas.repec.org/p/ess/wpaper/id12952.html,http://www.esocialsciences.org/Download/repecDownload.aspx?fname=A20181213153123_29.pdf&fcategory=Articles&AId=12952&fref=repec,RePEc:ess:wpaper:id:12952,"Mitali Das, 2018.

,Investment in Research and Development for Basmati Rice in Pakistan,Asian Development Bank Institute,"Basmati rice is Pakistan's celebrated export. After years of growth, Pakistan's production and export of basmati has slipped and is on a downward trend. The absence of a strong research and development institutional structure makes it extremely difficult for the sector to prepare for new challenges. The status of basmati rice as a major export commodity hides the fact that its contribution is below its potential. Without a policy commitment to elevate basmati rice as a strategic product, it will continue to be impacted by changing economic and environmental conditions. Extra funding for basmati can be easily channeled from the levy that is being collected from its export or through government development funds. The bigger challenge is changing the embedded mindset that fails to connect research and development with the production and commercialization of basmati.","eSS, basmati rice, Pakistan, rice export, agriculture R&D, downward trend, institutional structure, commodity, potential, economic condition, environmental conditions, government development funds, Production, commercialization of basmati, Pakistan, All these keywords",https://ideas.repec.org/p/ess/wpaper/id12951.html,http://www.esocialsciences.org/Download/repecDownload.aspx?fname=A20181213152252_29.pdf&fcategory=Articles&AId=12951&fref=repec,RePEc:ess:wpaper:id:12951,"Asian Development Bank Institute, 2018.

,Mobility and congestion in urban India,"Prottoy A. Akbar, Victor Couture, Gilles Duranton, Adam Storeygard","The paper presents the development of a methodology to estimate robust city-level vehicular mobility indices, and apply it to 154 Indian cities using 22 million counterfactual trips measured by a web mapping service. There is wide variation in mobility across cities. An exact decomposition shows this variation is driven more by differences in uncongested mobility than congestion. Under plausible assumptions, a one-standard-deviation improvement in uncongested speed creates much more mobility than optimal congestion pricing. Denser and more populated cities are slower, only in part because of congestion. Urban economic development is correlated with better (uncongested and overall) mobility despite worse congestion.","eSS, urban transportation, roads, traffic, determinants of travel speed, cities, mobility, congestion, India, All these keywords",https://ideas.repec.org/p/ess/wpaper/id12949.html,http://www.esocialsciences.org/Download/repecDownload.aspx?fname=A2018112214939_29.pdf&fcategory=Articles&AId=12949&fref=repec,RePEc:ess:wpaper:id:12949,"Prottoy A.

Technological advancement, global integration, regulation of labor market and structural transformation also play important roles in the distribution of income. However, the process of structural transformation, technological advancement, and the promotion of skill deepening varies significantly across developing economies. It is imperative that we identify the factors behind these diverse trends to design policies for a more equitable distribution of income in the developing economies.

,Social Funding of Green Financing: An Application of Distributed Ledger Technologies,"Naoyuki Yoshino, Tim Schloesser, Farhad Hesary","This paper contributes to the literature in two ways: First, it delineates a concrete application of DLTs in the field of green financing, which offers the potential to increase social welfare. Second, the decision problem of investors is modeled, which illustrates through which channel the use of DLTs impacts the investors' behavior. To achieve the sustainable development goals (SDGs) as well as the Paris Agreement major investments in renewable energy (RE) production are necessary worldwide. In particular, decentralized, small-scale projects offer copious potential to create energy access as well as to contribute to an affordable, reliable and sustainable energy supply system. However, in developing countries such projects often face issues in finding funding. Direct private investment tools like the community-based hometown investment trust (HIT) fund address this issue and offer a way of financing for those projects.

,Looking Beyond the Farm and Household: Determinants of On-farm Diversification in India,Varun Kumar Das,"This paper analyses the factors affecting on-farm diversification decision. Notwithstanding the influence of farm and household conditions, studies have also highlighted the role of external pull factors on farm diversification. Though appraised in scholarship, this aspect has eluded an empirical scrutiny in literature. Taking India as a case, this study shows that apart from farm and household factors, there is a broader agro-ecological and structural feature which impacts on-farm diversification decision. Correcting for endogeneity in a seemingly unrelated system of ordered probit models, a ""three-stage"" residual inclusion model is estimated. The findings show that proximity to social infrastructure such as schools, colleges, and access to public transport matters for diversification. Results also show that though urbanization may increase demand for variety of products, it might as well impinge upon farm labor supply as non-farm opportunities also rises with urbanization. Thus, the underlying structure of the local economy also merits attention while understanding on-farm diversification process.","eSS, IGIDR, Farm diversification, Pull factors, External conditions, Residual inclusion, Economies of density, Agro-ecology, Urbanization, Structural transformation, All these keywords",https://ideas.repec.org/p/ess/wpaper/id12945.html,http://www.esocialsciences.org/Download/repecDownload.aspx?fname=A20181120181855_29.pdf&fcategory=Articles&AId=12945&fref=repec,RePEc:ess:wpaper:id:12945,"Varun Kumar Das, 2018.

,Indian Banks and the Prevention of Corruption Act: Freedom and Discipline,Ashima Goyal,"Selfless activists like Mr. Pai teach us the importance of continuously interrogating the functioning of our democracy. The NPA issue has persisted for almost a decade. It has eroded the profitability of banks, and is a problem for depositors, although sovereign guarantee mitigates concerns. Since large infrastructure loans were made to private firms, there were fears of private enrichment at the expense of the tax-payer. The institutions to curb corruption were geared to a control regime, and in the post-reform market-based system did not make the crucial distinction between crime and risk-taking. Their actions paralyzed decision-making and delayed resolution. The Prevention of Corruption Act has recently been amended, but partly because the differing requirements of a control and market-based system are not well-understood some have criticized it as being too soft on corruption while others see it as continuing to hurt decision-making. After examining the combination of discipline and freedom a market-based system requires we assess the 2018 amendment on those criteria. We also more broadly examine changes in incentives and social norms that are likely to reduce corruption as well as resolution delays.","eSS, Public sector banks, Non-performing Assets, Prevention of Corruption Act, democracy, profitability of banks, infrastructure loans, private firms, tax - payers, decision making, market- based system, corruption, discipline and freedom, incentives, social norms, resolution delays., All these keywords",https://ideas.repec.org/p/ess/wpaper/id12944.html,http://www.esocialsciences.org/Download/repecDownload.aspx?fname=A20181029101823_29.pdf&fcategory=Articles&AId=12944&fref=repec,RePEc:ess:wpaper:id:12944,"Ashima Goyal, 2018.

,Does Regional Integration Matter for Inclusive Growth? Evidence from the Multidimensional Regional Integration Index,"Cyn-Young Park, Racquel Claveria","This paper employs a multidimensional approach to gauge the degree of regional integration and analyze impact on growth, inequality, and poverty.

The MDRII confirms that regional integration is most advanced in the European Union which scores high in all six dimensions; Asia comes second with the largest contribution from infrastructure and connectivity. Empirical analysis suggests significant and positive development impact of regional integration even when trade and financial openness is controlled. The regional value chain, movement of people, and institutional and social integration dimensions have been significant drivers of economic growth. Infrastructure and connectivity improve income distribution. Overall integration alongside the dimensions of trade and investment, money and finance, and institutional and social integration appear to significantly and robustly reduce poverty.","eSS, composite index, economic growth, inequality, poverty, regional integration, multidimensional regional integration index (MDRII), trade, investment, money, finance, regional value chains, infrastructure, movement of people, institutional, social integration., All these keywords",https://ideas.repec.org/p/ess/wpaper/id12940.html,http://www.esocialsciences.org/Download/repecDownload.aspx?fname=A201810261273_29.pdf&fcategory=Articles&AId=12940&fref=repec,RePEc:ess:wpaper:id:12940,"Cyn-Young Park & Racquel Claveria, 2018.

,Role of Bank Lending in Financing Green Projects: A Dynamic Stochastic General Equilibrium Approach,Maria Teresa Punzi,"This paper develops an environmental dynamic stochastic general equilibrium (E-DSGE) model with heterogeneous production sectors. In particular, the model comprises some low-carbon emission firms that finance their investments and production only through banking loans, and high-carbon emission firms that finance their investments either with bank loans or by issuing equities. Moreover, government imposes intensity targets to reduce pollution, and high-carbon emission firms buy permits to allow their production. The model studies the transmission mechanism of technology, monetary, and financial shocks and finds that only a positive financial shock to green firms can boost production and credit for the green sector. A financial shock can be interpreted as the borrowing capacity of firms in terms of tightening or relaxing the enforcement of collateral constraints. In contrast, a positive technology shock and easier monetary policy lead only to a short output on impact, but in the longer term green firms experience losses. Later, the paper analyzes the impact of several macro prudential policies and finds that only differentiated capital requirements can help to sustain green financing.","eSS, E-DSGE model, environmental policy, green financing, macroprudential policy, environmental dynamic stochastic general equilibrium (E-DSGE) model, heterogeneous production sectors, low-carbon emission firms, investment, production, banking loans, equities, pollution, transmission mechanism of technology, monetary, shocks., All these keywords",https://ideas.repec.org/p/ess/wpaper/id12938.html,http://www.esocialsciences.org/Download/repecDownload.aspx?fname=A20181019142458_29.pdf&fcategory=Articles&AId=12938&fref=repec,RePEc:ess:wpaper:id:12938,"Maria Teresa Punzi, 2018.

,"Demand for Information on Environmental Health Risk, Mode of Delivery, and Behavioral Change: Evidence from Sonargaon, Bangladesh","Ricardo Maertens, Alessandro Tarozzi, Kazi Matin Ahmed, Alexander van Geen","Lack of access to reliable information on environmental exposure limits opportunities for risk avoiding behavior, particularly in developing countries. Private markets could potentially play a role in providing such information if households cannot rely on the public sector.

It first sets up a principal-agent model focusing on bundling effects of procurement based on Hart (2003), and Iossa and Martimort (2015) to see under which conditions PPP has advantages over traditional procurement and vice versa. Then, it considers if the Republic of Korea's PPP structure in practice is well designed to maximize efficiency regarding the theoretical model. By reviewing the data on major investors and equity transactions of the Republic of Korea's PPP projects, it also shows that the bundling effects of PPP contracts, which is one of the main sources of efficiency, is limited under the current economic and political environment and derive policy implications for developing countries implementing PPP projects in the region.","eSS, traditional procurement, Public-Private Partnership (PPP), procurement contracts, public sector, private sector, principal-agent, Republic of Korea, economic, environment, political, policy implication, PPP projects., All these keywords",https://ideas.repec.org/p/ess/wpaper/id12928.html,http://www.esocialsciences.org/Download/repecDownload.aspx?fname=A2018927114423_29.pdf&fcategory=Articles&AId=12928&fref=repec,RePEc:ess:wpaper:id:12928,"Hojun Lee & Kiwan Kim, 2018.

The 2005 Hindu Succession Act was legislated to protect women's rights to an equal share in ancestral property, including land. Using a unique rural household survey from Eastern Uttar Pradesh, Bihar, Odisha, and West Bengal where female enumerators were employed to interview female participants, we find that only 3% of the 8,000 rural households randomly selected in those four states have their land registered under women's names. Controlling for the potential endogeneity of land title ownership, it finds that women's land title ownership has positive effects on their participation in decisions about farming, livelihood, and household activities. Using state leveldisaggregated data, however, we find that the signs and magnitudes of the impacts differ across the four states whose social and economic norms are diverse.","eSS, women's rights, land title, ownership, empowerment, rural areas, Hindu Succession Act, ancestral property, female participation, women's land title ownership, farming, livelihood, household activities, social norms, economic norms., All these keywords",https://ideas.repec.org/p/ess/wpaper/id12926.html,http://www.esocialsciences.org/Download/repecDownload.aspx?fname=A2018926151048_29.pdf&fcategory=Articles&AId=12926&fref=repec,RePEc:ess:wpaper:id:12926,"Harold Glenn A.

,Money and Business Cycle: Evidence From India,"Ashima Goyal, Abhishek Kumar","This paper takes a New Keynesian model with non-separable money in utility to Indian data using maximum likelihood. The identification problem in isolating the effect of money on output and inflation is solved by adjusting real balances for shifts in money demand. Estimates with an extended model with relevant features like partial indexation in prices, markup shock and time varying inflation target, show that real balances do affect output and inflation even after correcting for money demand unlike results for the United States and Eurozone. A regression estimate and multivariate structural vector autoregression give similar results. Types of money matter. Reserve money has the largest impact, pointing to the importance of the informal sector. The estimated income elasticity of narrow money is more than twice that of broad money, pointing to the dependence of firms on banks. Interest semi elasticity of money demand is close to one. Responsiveness of output to real interest rate is high. We find that interest rate setting is quite persistent. Coefficient of lagged interest rate varies from 0.71 to 0.95. The paper concludes that there is a significant asymmetry in the role of money in India (an emerging economy) in comparison to United States and Eurozone (advanced economies).","eSS, DSGE, India, IS, LM, Money Demand, Maximum Likelihood, Inflation, Monetary Policy, Supply Shock, non-separable money, likelihood, money demand, indexation in prices, inflation target, multivariate structural vector autoregression, inflromal sector, firms, banks, money demand, interest rate., All these keywords",https://ideas.repec.org/p/ess/wpaper/id12925.html,http://www.esocialsciences.org/Download/repecDownload.aspx?fname=A20189211309_29.pdf&fcategory=Articles&AId=12925&fref=repec,RePEc:ess:wpaper:id:12925,"Ashima Goyal & Abhishek Kumar, 2018.

Emphasis is placed on the transition of the networks before and after the Asian financial crisis of 1997-1998 and the global financial crisis of 2008-2009. The analysis demonstrates the increase in interconnectedness during periods of stress and the fall in the number of links in postcrisis periods. At the same time, the results reveal a general deepening of the connections of the Asian market with the rest of the world over the past 2 decades. They also suggest that many of these markets have transitioned from being primarily linked to developed non-Asian markets through key bridge markets (such as Hong Kong, China) to developing stronger direct links with these external markets, highlighting the importance of key geographical nodes in market development.","eSS, Asian markets, financial crises, network, financial markets, Asian financial crisis, Network links, involvement of nodes, spreaders, absorbers, Association of Southeast Asian Nations Markets., All these keywords",https://ideas.repec.org/p/ess/wpaper/id12924.html,http://www.esocialsciences.org/Download/repecDownload.aspx?fname=A201892112538_29.pdf&fcategory=Articles&AId=12924&fref=repec,RePEc:ess:wpaper:id:12924,"Biplob Chowdhury & Mardi Dungey & Moses Kangogo & Mohammad Abu Sayeed & Vladimir Volkov, 2018.

Using the Kaplan Meier estimator model in both the exports coming from MSME and the total trade data, the study documented the survival rate of goods and duration of Philippine exported goods. The research shows that most export relationships of the Philippines are brief, contrary to conventional trade theories which suggest that most trade relationships will be long-lived.

,Bribes vs. Taxes: Market Structure and Incentives,"Francesco Amodio, Jieun Choi, Giacomo de Giorgi, Aminur Rahman","Firms in developing countries often avoid paying taxes by making informal payments to tax officials. These bribes may raise the cost of operating a business, and the price charged to consumers. To decrease these costs, the author has designed a feedback incentive scheme for business tax inspectors that reward them according to the anonymous evaluation submitted by inspected firms. It shows theoretically that feedback incentives decrease the equilibrium bribe amount, but make firms with more inelastic demand more attractive for inspectors. A tilted scheme that attaches higher weights to the evaluation of smaller firms limits the scope for targeting and decreases the bribe amount to a lesser extent. The paper evaluates both schemes in a field experiment in the Kyrgyz Republic and find evidence that is consistent with the model predictions. By decreasing bribes, our intervention reduces the average cost for firms and the price they charge to consumers. Since fewer firms substitute bribes for taxes, tax revenues increase. Our study highlights the role of firm heterogeneity and market structure in shaping the relationship between firms and tax inspectors, and provides clear evidence of pass-through of bribes to consumers.","eSS, : business tax, incentives, market structure, demand elasticity, bribes, bribes to consumer, Kyrgyz Republic, developing countries, informal payment, tax officials, business, prices, incentive scheme, business tax inspector, model predictions., All these keywords",https://ideas.repec.org/p/ess/wpaper/id12919.html,http://www.esocialsciences.org/Download/repecDownload.aspx?fname=A20189171407_29.pdf&fcategory=Articles&AId=12919&fref=repec,RePEc:ess:wpaper:id:12919,"Francesco Amodio & Jieun Choi & Giacomo de Giorgi & Aminur Rahman, 2018.

It began by developing a model of educational choice with and without bride price. The model generates a number of predictions that was tested in two countries that have had large-scale school construction projects, Indonesia and Zambia. Consistent with the model, it was found that for groups that practice the custom of bride price, the value of bride price payments that the parents receive tend to increase with their daughter's education. As a consequence, the probability of a girl being educated is higher among bride price groups. The model also predicts that families from bride price groups will be the most responsive to policies, like school construction, that are aimed at increasing female education.","eSS, bride price, culture, marriage customs, education, girl education, school construction project, development policy, female education, development programs, traditional marriage customs, cost of education, educational investment, educational attainments, enrolment., All these keywords",https://ideas.repec.org/p/ess/wpaper/id12917.html,http://www.esocialsciences.org/Download/repecDownload.aspx?fname=A2018917133833_29.pdf&fcategory=Articles&AId=12917&fref=repec,RePEc:ess:wpaper:id:12917,"Nava Ashraf & Natalie Bau & Nathan Nunn & Alessandra Voena, 2018.

When other things are controlled, the effect of financial market integration on income inequality depends on financial market development. In a country with underdeveloped financial market, income inequality gets worse as financial market opens. On the other hand, when financial market is highly developed, the effect of financial market openness on income inequality is mostly insignificant in a statistical sense. The results are still valid with different measures of financial market development, integration, and income inequality.

,Strengthening India's External Intelligence Infrastructure: An Assessment,Shantanu K. Bansal,"This paper outlines a number of points, which would help to develop a more superior external intelligence infrastructure. In absence of a national security strategy (NSS), the task of intelligence agencies in India has failed to be systemic. India's intelligence infrastructure lacks a holistic view and very less effort has been put to reorganize intelligence infrastructure o the basis of contemporary threat perceptions. Without a strong security infrastructure country cannot eye towards becoming a regional power. Due to a rigid security system, India has a disparate intelligence mechanism in service. While little effort has gone towards synergizing all sources of intelligence and request dissemination in real time/ near real time basis. To address these concerns, the external intelligence infrastructure primarily needs to undergo a drastic review. Secondly, it needs to be ascertained that the failure in generation of intelligence on strategic level is not due to the failure in action but due to its inherent structure. Although many efforts have gone in to recognize the problems faced by the agencies, less effort have been veined in to provide a good organizational structure based on the problems faced by these agencies.","eSS, national security strategy (NSS), intelligence agencies, intelligence infrastructure, holistic view, security infrastructure, strategic level, structure, good organization., All these keywords",https://ideas.repec.org/p/ess/wpaper/id12910.html,http://www.esocialsciences.org/Download/repecDownload.aspx?fname=A201894135143_29.pdf&fcategory=Articles&AId=12910&fref=repec,RePEc:ess:wpaper:id:12910,"Shantanu K.

Calomiris, Sophia Chen","The paper constructs a new measure of the changing generosity of deposit insurance for many countries, empirically model the international influences on the adoption and generosity of deposit insurance, and show that the expansion of deposit insurance generosity increased asset risk in banking systems. It considers three asset risk measures: higher loans-to-assets, a higher proportion of lending to households, and a higher proportion of mortgage lending. None of the observed increases in these indicators is offset by declines in banking system leverage. The paper shows that increased asset risk explains at least part of the positive association between deposit insurance and the likelihood and severity of systemic banking crises.","eSS, deposit insurance, global rise, bank asset risk, generosity of deposit insurance, insurance, banking system, risk management, risk measures, higher loans-to-assets, a higher proportion of lending to households, mortgage lending, asset risk, positive association, likelihood, systemic banking crises, All these keywords",https://ideas.repec.org/p/ess/wpaper/id12909.html,http://www.esocialsciences.org/Download/repecDownload.aspx?fname=A201893134158_29.pdf&fcategory=Articles&AId=12909&fref=repec,RePEc:ess:wpaper:id:12909,"Charles W.

,Misallocation in the Market for Inputs: Enforcement and the Organization of Production,"Johannes Boehm, Ezra Oberfield","The strength of contract enforcement determines how firms source inputs and organize production. Using microdata on Indian manufacturing plants, it shows that production and sourcing decisions appear systematically distorted in states with weaker enforcement. Specifically, it documenst that in industries that tend to rely more heavily on relationship specific intermediate inputs, plants in states with more congested courts shift their expenditures away from intermediate inputs and appear to be more vertically integrated. To quantify the impact of these distortions on aggregate productivity, it constructs a model in which plants have several ways of producing, each with different bundles of inputs. Weak enforcement exacerbates a holdup problem that arises when using inputs that require customization, distorting both the intensive and extensive margins of input use. The equilibrium organization of production and the network structure of input-output linkages arise endogenously from the producers' simultaneous cost minimization decisions. The paper identifies the structural parameters that govern enforcement frictions from cross-state variation in the first moments of producers' cost shares. A set of counterfactuals show that enforcement frictions lower aggregate productivity to an extent that is relevant on the macro scale.","eSS, market, enforcement, organization of production, micro-data, production, sourcing decision, weaker enforcement, aggregate production, equilibrium, organization of production, producers, parameters, cost share, macro scale., All these keywords",https://ideas.repec.org/p/ess/wpaper/id12908.html,http://www.esocialsciences.org/Download/repecDownload.aspx?fname=A201893133731_29.pdf&fcategory=Articles&AId=12908&fref=repec,RePEc:ess:wpaper:id:12908,"Johannes Boehm & Ezra Oberfield, 2018.

,Market Expanding or Market Stealing? Platform Competition in Bike-Sharing,"Guangyu Cao, Ginger Zhe Jin, Li-An Zhou","The recent rise of dockless bike-sharing is dominated by two platforms: one started first in 82 Chinese cities, 59 of which were subsequently entered by the second platform. Using these variations, the paper studies how the entrant affects the incumbent's market performance. To our surprise, the entry expands the market for the incumbent, not only boosting its total number of trips but also allowing the incumbent to achieve higher revenue per trip, improve bike utilization rate, and form a wider and more evenly distributed network. These market expansion effects dominate a significant market-stealing effect on the incumbent's old users. The findings suggest that platform entry can divert the perceived path to winners-take-all in a market with positive network effects, and competition with the outside goods is at least as important as the competition between platforms, especially when users multi-home across compatible networks.","eSS, market expanding, market stealing, competition, bike sharing, chinese countries, China, market performance, revenue, bike utilization rate, market-stealing effect, All these keywords",https://ideas.repec.org/p/ess/wpaper/id12907.html,http://www.esocialsciences.org/Download/repecDownload.aspx?fname=A201891131942_29.pdf&fcategory=Articles&AId=12907&fref=repec,RePEc:ess:wpaper:id:12907,"Guangyu Cao & Ginger Zhe Jin & Li-An Zhou, 2018.

,The People's Republic of China's Long-Run Growth through the Lens of the Export-Led Growth Model,"Jesus Felipe, Matteo Lanzafame","The People's Republic of China's (PRC) remarkable growth performance over the last 3 decades has been associated to very robust export growth, so much so that many refer to it as a clear example of export-led growth (ELG). Using the concept of the balance-of-payments equilibrium (BOPE) growth rate, which provides a framework to test the ELG hypothesis, we show that the PRC's actual long-run growth is well approximated by its BOPE growth rate. This growth rate is given by the ratio of the growth rate of exports to the income elasticity of imports. It estimates the latter using the Kalman filter, which allows us to obtain a time-varying estimate of the PRC's BOPE growth rate. It also finds that the average value of the PRC's BOPE growth rate during 1981-2016 was 11%, but it varied significantly over time and declined notably after 2007. Today, it is estimated at a much lower 5.9%. Then it discusses the determinants of the PRC's BOPE growth rate and of the income elasticity of imports, with the help of the Bayesian model averaging technique. The analysis highlights the role of the composition of aggregate demand as the main driving force, both for its direct effects on the income elasticity of imports, and for the indirect effects on export growth via capital accumulation, in particular fixed asset investment. Our analysis has important implications to understand the PRC's transition to a ""New Normal"" of a lower growth rate.","eSS, balance-of-payments equilibrium growth rate, Bayesian model averaging, export-led growth, Kalman filter, People's Republic of China (PRC), balance-of-payments equilibrium (BOPE), export-led growth (ELG), income elasticity, PRC's BOPE growth rate., All these keywords",https://ideas.repec.org/p/ess/wpaper/id12900.html,http://www.esocialsciences.org/Download/repecDownload.aspx?fname=A2018829143818_29.pdf&fcategory=Articles&AId=12900&fref=repec,RePEc:ess:wpaper:id:12900,"Jesus Felipe & Matteo Lanzafame, 2018.

,Assessing the Effects of Simple and Complex Innovation Strategies on the Performance of Firms in the Philippines,"Connie Bayudan-Dacuycuy, Lora Kryz C. Baje","Innovation is the synergistic use of resources, technology, capital, and information to achieve growth at different levels of the economy. Many studies abroad have already supported the hypothesis that innovation leads to a good firm performance and long-term economic growth. In the Philippines, some studies already analyze the effects of simple innovations on firm performance. However, emerging literature shows that complex innovation strategies have bigger impacts than simple ones. In line with this strand of research, this paper analyzes the effects of simple and complex innovations on labor productivity and employment growth. Results show that there is no single best innovation strategy that a firm must undertake. However, if firms are constrained by their budget, a simple innovation will help in improving labor productivity and to some extent, employment growth. Firms that do not face cost issues can benefit more from adopting a complex innovation strategy. In addition, several specific types of complex innovation strategies can be adapted depending on whether the firm aims to increase its employment or to boost its labor productivity.","labor productivity, employment growth, simple innovation, complex innovation, resources, technology, capital, information, economy, economic growth, firm performance, employment growth, cost, complex innovation strategy., All these keywords",https://ideas.repec.org/p/ess/wpaper/id12899.html,http://www.esocialsciences.org/Download/repecDownload.aspx?fname=A2018827145458_29.pdf&fcategory=Articles&AId=12899&fref=repec,RePEc:ess:wpaper:id:12899,"Connie Bayudan-Dacuycuy & Lora Kryz C.

,Vulnerability to Poverty in the Philippines: An Examination of Trends from 2003 to 2015,"Jose Ramon G. Albert, Jana Flor V. Vizmanos","The reduction of poverty is at the heart of the development agenda both nationally and globally. This is reflected in the Philippine Development Plan, and the worldwide commitment toward the Sustainable Development Goals. While the measurement of poverty is ex post and thus public interventions are directed at helping those who have been identified as poor, the government must broaden the scope of assessments and take account of the dynamics in poverty in public policy. A critical dimension to poverty dynamics is vulnerability which conceptually pertains to the risk to future poverty. Some of the poor are likely to be poor in the future; some non-poor may also become poor if idiosyncratic and covariate risks to future poverty are not addressed. Thus, risk resilience management strategies are critical. This study continued previous work that involves estimating the vulnerability level of households to income poverty using a modified probit model based on income and other poverty correlates data sourced from the Family Income and Expenditure Survey, as well as the country's official poverty lines. Past model specifications are improved on by including data on price and climate shocks to welfare, as well as generating the assessment for urban areas alone and for rural areas alone before combining the cross-section results, rather than using a common specification nationally as was done previously. The vulnerability assessment in this study provide inputs to forward-looking interventions that build the resilience of households for preventing or reducing the likelihood of future poverty. The study makes a case for the need to make use of both poverty and vulnerability estimates in programs, and come up with differentiated actions for those highly vulnerable and relatively vulnerable.","eSS, vulnerability, poverty, highly vulnerable, relatively vulnerable, risk, resilience, development agenda, Philippine Development Plan, Sustainable Development Goals, measurement of poverty, public interventions, poor, public policy, poverty dynamics, idiosyncratic and covariate risks, risk resilience management strategies., All these keywords",https://ideas.repec.org/p/ess/wpaper/id12898.html,http://www.esocialsciences.org/Download/repecDownload.aspx?fname=A2018827144847_29.pdf&fcategory=Articles&AId=12898&fref=repec,RePEc:ess:wpaper:id:12898,"Jose Ramon G.

,Public-Private Partnership Development in Southeast Asia,Fauziah Zen,"Infrastructure development in Southeast Asia has been financed mainly by public funds, which leave wide gaps in majority of countries. Governments have tried to attract the private sector by offering various schemes under public-private partnership (PPP). Typically, PPP contributes less than 1% of gross domestic product, while public finance greatly varies from about 2% to 10% of a country's gross domestic product. Among major factors supporting PPP implementation, the following features are critical: coherent policy, public sector capacity to manage PPP appropriately, public sector willingness to have mutual relation with private partners, and leadership. Private participation is still continuously growing; and its implementation is not limited to hard infrastructure only, but also to social infrastructure.","eSS, infrastructure development, private sector participation, public-private partnership, social infrastructures, Southeast Asia, public funds, private sector, public-private partnership (PPP), public finance, PPP implementation, public sector, private partners, leadership, private participation, social infrastructure, All these keywords",https://ideas.repec.org/p/ess/wpaper/id12892.html,http://www.esocialsciences.org/Download/repecDownload.aspx?fname=A2018816142112_29.pdf&fcategory=Articles&AId=12892&fref=repec,RePEc:ess:wpaper:id:12892,"Fauziah Zen, 2018.

,Financial Barriers to Development of Renewable and Green Energy Projects in Asia,Hooman Peimani,"The expansion of green renewable energy has been very limited in all the Asian countries, despite their various differences. The contributing factors are numerous, but, the financial factor has been the single major factor determining whether or not a country opts for such energy. This is notwithstanding awareness about the unsustainability of fossil energy dominated energy mixes, both for environmental and economic reasons. The main culprit is Asia's bank-dominated financial system with its underdeveloped capital market, which leaves Asian banks as the major source of funding for green renewable energy projects. Considering these projects as very risky with low rate of return on their invested capital, their reluctance to finance them has been the major barrier to the expansion of green renewable energy in Asia. Addressing the financing challenge is both possible and necessary to remove the barrier to green energy expansion in Asia.","eSS, renewable energy financing, sustainable development, sustainable energy, green renewable energy, Asian countries, financial factors, energy, environmental reasons, economic reasons, awareness, the unsustainability, financial system, capital market, capital, low rate of returns, green energy, All these keywords",https://ideas.repec.org/p/ess/wpaper/id12891.html,http://www.esocialsciences.org/Download/repecDownload.aspx?fname=A201881614512_29.pdf&fcategory=Articles&AId=12891&fref=repec,RePEc:ess:wpaper:id:12891,"Hooman Peimani, 2018.

,Managing Credit Risk and Improving Access to Finance in Green Energy Projects,Purkayastha Dhruba,"The cost of finance has a relatively high impact on the returns and viability of clean energy projects compared with fossil fuel-based energy projects, because the operating costs for renewable energy projects are very low. Credit risk assessment and ratings, which have usually been an inappropriate measure of credit risk for clean energy finance, have a significant influence on the cost of finance. Factors like inadequate credit information, a lack of historical data at the project level, and the higher risk of technological obsolescence lead to credit market failure in clean energy finance, leading to mispricing of risk and poor capital allocation to clean energy infrastructure in the economy. Access to institutional finance is more constrained in the distributed renewable energy sector, as the transaction costs are high, consumer credit risk is high or unknown, and a variety of other challenges exist. It is important to ease these constraints, through appropriate policy and financing interventions to crowd in domestic banks, by improving the quality of credit information, both technical and commercial, creating suitable financial intermediaries, and providing risk mitigation solutions","eSS, corporate finance, financial risk, financing, ratings and rating agencies, renewable energy, finance, clean energy project, fuel-based energy projects, operating costs, Credit risk assessment, clean energy finance, credit information, historical data, technological obsolescence, renewable energy sector., All these keywords",https://ideas.repec.org/p/ess/wpaper/id12890.html,http://www.esocialsciences.org/Download/repecDownload.aspx?fname=A2018813142730_29.pdf&fcategory=Articles&AId=12890&fref=repec,RePEc:ess:wpaper:id:12890,"Purkayastha Dhruba, 2018.

,Financing Solar Photovoltaic Transition: From Utility to Residential Market Adoption in Emerging Economies,"Ranaporn Tantiwechwuttikul, Masaru Yarime","This paper examines the advantages and disadvantages of different financial schemes for introducing PV facilities in terms of the suitability of funding vehicles and investment mechanisms. Given the policy expense curtailment, owing to the gradual PV competitiveness, the analysis particularly focuses on the emerging market for PV installations for self-consumption. As the main obstacle is the high upfront cost of PV systems, it examines the new financial models in which customers buy the service rather than PV system per se. It considers what conditions would be necessary to facilitate the third-party ownership models and alternative financing schemes. Finally, this paper discusses what policy measures and instruments can be deployed to foster further PV adoption in the context of emerging economies.

,Determinants of Public-Private Partnerships in Infrastructure in Asia: Implications for Capital Market Development,"Suk Hyun, Donghyun Park, Shu Tian","This study attempts to understand the role of greater access to finance, i.e., stocks, bonds, and bank loans, in public-private partnership (PPP) investment in developing countries. Most developing countries still depend heavily on fiscal financing for infrastructure projects. The empirical results reconfirm the fact that banks remain the major source of finance for infrastructure projects. The domestic bond market should be further developed to have depth and liquidity enough to provide longterm funding for private sector investors. Interestingly, it finds a negative impact of bond market development on PPP investment. A possible interpretation is that financing through government bonds, which dominates bond markets in developing countries, discourages private sector participation by reducing financing access to the corporate bond market. The evidence underlines the importance of a well-functioning corporate bond market in developing countries, which can offer long-term financing to private sector participation in infrastructure investments.","eSS, bond market development, government bond, public-private partnership, stocks, bonds, bank loans, public-private partnership (PPP), investments, fiscal financing, infrastructure projects., All these keywords",https://ideas.repec.org/p/ess/wpaper/id12887.html,http://www.esocialsciences.org/Download/repecDownload.aspx?fname=A2018810172934_29.pdf&fcategory=Articles&AId=12887&fref=repec,RePEc:ess:wpaper:id:12887,"Suk Hyun & Donghyun Park & Shu Tian, 2018.

,Credit Risk Reduction Effect on Small and Medium- Sized Enterprise Finance Through the Use of Bank Account Information,"Naoko Nemoto, Naoyuki Yoshino, Yutaka Okubo, Daimei Inaba, Kentaro Yanagisawa","This paper verifies the impact of bank account information, such as information on deposits and withdrawals, that is not necessarily fully accounted for in conventional internal ratings and that can affect the accuracy of the default predictions of small and medium-sized enterprises (SMEs). The analysis demonstrates that the accuracy of default predictions improves when a model based on bank account information is used in addition to the default prediction model based on traditional financial information. The analysis also shows that the degree of improvement increases when the size of the company is small. For small companies, the quality of financial data is generally assumed to be low, but the bank account information model can complement the incomplete data. In addition, for small firms, the bank account information model shows better default prediction capability compared to the financial model, which implies the possibility that banks could extend loans even if only the bank account information is available. The correlation coefficients of the financial model and the bank account model are higher than 50% but not very high, suggesting that these models evaluate borrowers from different perspectives.","eSS, small and medium-sized enterprise finance, credit risk analysis, big data, bank account information, deposits, withdrawals, conventional, internal ratings, accuracy, default predictions, small and medium-sized enterprises (SMEs)., All these keywords",https://ideas.repec.org/p/ess/wpaper/id12886.html,http://www.esocialsciences.org/Download/repecDownload.aspx?fname=A2018810164212_29.pdf&fcategory=Articles&AId=12886&fref=repec,RePEc:ess:wpaper:id:12886,"Naoko Nemoto & Naoyuki Yoshino & Yutaka Okubo & Daimei Inaba & Kentaro Yanagisawa, 2018.

A case study of the transformation affecting the villages in and around the new Financial District of the Hi-tech city around Hyderabad was undertaken with the limited aim of focusing on the cultural loss due to these fast moving changes and the way the society thus impacted remembered its heritage. The reflections in this essay are about the unequal access to resources and facilities that the inner core of the settlement experiences, surrounded as it is by opulence of an unimaginable kind. While these conditions of materiality are important and deserve our attention, it is the tenacity of thoughts, emotions and social relations - all embedded in the cognitive space of people emanating out of these - that permit us to still access the cultural past of a community.

,Enabling Smart Urban Redevelopment in India through Floor Area Ratio Incentives,"Apoorva Shenvi, Ron H.

A thorough analysis of Mumbai's cluster redevelopment approach revealed this mechanism has substantial potential for augmenting municipal revenue and contributing to public infrastructure improvements. However, its success is highly dependent on the local land and real estate markets, and it may not result in sustainable and inclusive development in the long term. Additionally, it also has significant spatial impacts that need to be considered when adapting this approach for other contexts. On the other hand, Ahmedabad's proposal for rejuvenating its central business district is still in its early stages, and requires careful assessment of land markets in the city, as well as infrastructure and service requirements generated by the increased population density. The implementing agencies need to formulate a mechanism that enables them to link revenue obtained from additional FAR to infrastructure improvements in the area from which it originates.","eSS, incentives, FAR approach, economic value, urban land, Mumbai's cluster redevelopment approach, municipal revenue, public infrastructure improvements, real estate markets, sustainable development, inclusive development, spatial impacts, land markets, population density, Mumbai and Ahmedabad., All these keywords",https://ideas.repec.org/p/ess/wpaper/id12877.html,http://www.esocialsciences.org/Download/repecDownload.aspx?fname=A2018725134330_29.pdf&fcategory=Articles&AId=12877&fref=repec,RePEc:ess:wpaper:id:12877,"Apoorva Shenvi & Ron H.

Chandrasekhar, Soham Sahoo","The paper analyses a nationally representative data set from India for the year 2013 in order to provide evidence on how short term migration is affected by household's ownership of land, and participation in agricultural activities. It estimates a recursive bivariate probit model recognizing the simultaneity between short term migration and decision to operate land. The results of the likelihood ratio test imply that it would be incorrect to ignore this simultaneity. Households with less than 1 hectare of land and those leasing out land are more likely to have a short term migrant (STM). Households leaving their land fallow, a common occurrence in south Asia, are more likely to have a STM. Moreover, choice of crops and livestock farming has a significant role to play in migration decision. Current initiatives to increase coverage of irrigation and facilitating access to formal finance could improve livelihoods of small and marginal farmers thereby reducing the probability of distress short-term migration.","eSS, Short term migrants, Small-marginal farmers, Agricultural households, Mobility, Asia, India, short term migrant (STM), land fallow, recursive bivariate probit model, land., All these keywords",https://ideas.repec.org/p/ess/wpaper/id12876.html,http://www.esocialsciences.org/Download/repecDownload.aspx?fname=A2018725131619_29.pdf&fcategory=Articles&AId=12876&fref=repec,RePEc:ess:wpaper:id:12876,"S.

,Fiscal policy Conditions for Government Budget Stability and Economic Recovery: Comparative Analysis of Japan and Greece,"Naoyuki Yoshino, Farhad Taghizadeh-Hesary, Tetsuro Mizoguchi","This paper first shows that the Domar condition is obtained only from the government budget constraint (namely the supply of government bonds) and does not take into account the demand for government bonds. Second, this paper reveals that Bohn's condition does not satisfy the condition of economic stability: even if this is satisfied, economic recovery may not be achieved. This paper will propose a new condition that satisfies both the stability of the government budget and the recovery of the economy. The paper's empirical findings from Japan demonstrate that in order to achieve fiscal sustainability, both sides of the Japanese government budget (expenditure and revenue) must be simultaneously adjusted while the decline in government expenditure has to exceed the increase in tax revenue. In addition, the paper provides a comparative analysis of Japan and Greece as evidence of the aforementioned condition, and proves that although Japan's debt-to-GDP ratio is higher than that of Greece, its bond market remains stable. This is because it comes from the demand side of the market and investors have greater confidence in this economy due to its lower credit risk rooted in the country's macroeconomic strength and more auspicious economic future.","eSS, Japanese bond market, Greece economy, fiscal sustainability, fiscal policy condition, government debt management, All these keywords",https://ideas.repec.org/p/ess/wpaper/id12873.html,http://www.esocialsciences.org/Download/repecDownload.aspx?fname=A20187191653_29.pdf&fcategory=Articles&AId=12873&fref=repec,RePEc:ess:wpaper:id:12873,"Naoyuki Yoshino & Farhad Taghizadeh-Hesary & Tetsuro Mizoguchi, 2018.

,Institutional Issues on Disaster Risk Reduction and Management,Sonny N. Domingo,"Ensuring the realization of the full potential of the incumbent DRRM policy requires appropriate sectoral and institutional translation of its espoused principles; reflecting more refined institutional arrangements, and policy and resource support. Strengthening institutional structures and crafting the appropriate platform for DRRM requires important decisions, particularly on the issue of mandate, jurisdiction, and response capability.

This review provides discourse on the livestock subsector's performance over the years, and look into ways of bettering outputs and competitive advantages both within domestic commodity systems and beyond. Enhancing the performance of the Philippine agriculture sector remains a key input to economic growth and inclusivity. Focus of development interventions in recent years have been on crops, particularly on the major grain staples. Shifting attention to more competitive and higher value commodities like livestock would do much in enhancing the livelihoods of smallholder farmers, as well as MSMEs within the sector.

Traditional interventions during and after major disaster events usually focus on the welfare of individuals and households, often at the expense or neglect of local economic recovery. The Price Act (RA7581) establishes a mechanism that supposedly protects consumers from inadequate supply of goods and unreasonable price increase in occasions of disasters and emergencies.

Using the primary data collected through survey (involving PWD enumerators) and key informant interviews with various stakeholders, the study found that both the rate and the quality of employment of PWD women in the study sites were generally low. These low employment outcomes of the respondents could be attributed to the following factors: low level of education, lack of training experience, lack of employment opportunities within a community, functioning limitations and low access to assistive devices and/or services, physical barriers and lack of PWD-friendly facilities, and low awareness on relevant policies and programs.

,A Probe into the Filipino Migration Culture: What Is There to Learn for Policy Intervention?,Aubrey D. Tabuga,"This paper seeks to address this gap in the literature by examining migration intentions of individuals from a high-emigration rural village in the Philippines. The results provide evidence of a culture of migration among the villagers as shown by the high proportion (at 44% of a sample of 572) of those having plans to leave for overseas work. The motivations for wanting to migrate are largely economic in nature. Earning high income is also the most common basis for choosing the destination. Nevertheless, the study shows that given more local job opportunities, a non-negligible proportion would opt to stay and be with their loved-ones. Interestingly, the desired amount of compensation abroad which roughly represents people's willingness to stay, is not much. The analysis also reveals that migration intentions do not exhibit a simple leave-or-stay dichotomy. Understanding the nuances is essential if policymakers want to shape people's migration-related behavior in its policy interventions.","labor migration, migration intentions, networks in migration, Philippines, migration-related survey data, high-emigration, high income, destination, compensation, leave-or-stay dichotomy, policy makers, policy intervention., All these keywords",https://ideas.repec.org/p/ess/wpaper/id12854.html,http://www.esocialsciences.org/Download/repecDownload.aspx?fname=A2018629135842_29.pdf&fcategory=Articles&AId=12854&fref=repec,RePEc:ess:wpaper:id:12854,"Aubrey D.

Such socio-historical lens is an unconventional approach in the analysis of international migration perpetuation. This study shows that the density of the kinship and friendship ties and the network position of pioneer migrants in the village have a role to play in the current distribution of migration behavior in the area. The current diffused characteristic of international migration in the village is likely to have been a function of the initial social configuration of pioneer migrants in the area.

The evaluation suggests that the cash transfer was able to help the beneficiaries smooth their food consumption as well as address some of their other needs such as medicines, housing repair, livelihood and education-related expenses. More than half of the cash was spent on food and this led to a decline in the malnutrition prevalence among children. Some households used part of the money to start or expand livelihood activities. The amount of the cash was very significant compared to their usual income and allowed them to purchase items that they would not ordinarily be able to purchase.

,Analyzing Decisiveness of Migration Intentions: Social Kinship that Matters,Aubrey D. Tabuga,"This paper therefore argues that using aggregate measures like migration incidence in an area wherein homogeneity is assumed and obtaining a significant and positive effect may erroneously amplify the power of migration network in the perpetuation of migration activities. Furthermore, the key to understand the process is to take into account the differences in individuals' phases of migration decision-making in the analysis of factors that influence the decisions. Indeed, network effects vary depending on where one is in the decision-making process. Migrant networks particularly the closest of kin are important in the advanced phase of concrete migration planning, and not in the initial stage. This is an evidence that migrant networks are not only important sources of migration-related information and aspirations but also sources of financial support or the money to move.","Migration intention, migration decision-making, Philippine migration, generalized ordered logit, tie strength, positive effect, migration activities, decision-making, kin, Migrant networks, migration planning, financial support, money., All these keywords",https://ideas.repec.org/p/ess/wpaper/id12848.html,http://www.esocialsciences.org/Download/repecDownload.aspx?fname=A2018628193847_29.pdf&fcategory=Articles&AId=12848&fref=repec,RePEc:ess:wpaper:id:12848,"Aubrey D.

,"Maternal Education, Parental Investment and Non-Cognitive Characteristics in Rural China","Jessica Leight, Elaine M. Liu","This paper evaluates the parental response to non-cognitive variation across siblings in rural Gansu province, China, employing a household fixed effects specification; the non-cognitive measures of interest are defined as the inverse of both externalizing challenges (behavioral problems and aggression) and internalizing challenges (anxiety and withdrawal). The results suggest that there is significant heterogeneity with respect to maternal education. More educated mothers appear to compensate for differences between their children, investing more in a child who exhibits greater non-cognitive deficits, while less educated mothers reinforce these differences. Most importantly, there is evidence that these compensatory investments are associated with the narrowing of non-cognitive deficits over time for children of more educated mothers, while there is no comparable pattern in households with less educated mothers.","eSS, non-cognitive characteristics, parental investment, intrahousehold allocation, employment, behavioral problems, aggression, anxiety, withdrawal, maternal education, non-cognitive deficits, less educated mothers, compensatory investments, China., All these keywords",https://ideas.repec.org/p/ess/wpaper/id12841.html,http://www.esocialsciences.org/Download/repecDownload.aspx?fname=A2018626143455_29.pdf&fcategory=Articles&AId=12841&fref=repec,RePEc:ess:wpaper:id:12841,"Jessica Leight & Elaine M.

,On Existence and Properties of Pure-strategy Equilibria under Contests,"Sakshi Gupta, Ram Singh","This paper strictly convex cost functions and demonstrate existence of pure strategy Nash equilibrium for the difference form. Moreover, it shows that several properties of equilibria and the comparative statics for the difference form closely resemble those for the ratio form. However, unlike the ratio form, under a difference form contest the existence of pure strategy Nash equilibrium is sensitive to the value of the prize. The use of 'ratio form' probability of success function dominates the existing literature on contests. Very few works have focused on the 'difference form' functions, notwithstanding their robust theoretical foundations and intuitive appeal in several contexts. Assuming the cost of efforts to be linear, Hirshleifer (1989) and Baik (1998) have argued that under the difference form contests, there is no interior pure strategy Nash equilibrium. In contrast, existence of interior pure strategy Nash equilibrium is well known for the ratio form contest functions.","eSS, Pure-strategy Equilibria, Nash equilibrium, prize, probability of success, robust theoretical foundations, intuitive appeal, strategy, contest., All these keywords",https://ideas.repec.org/p/ess/wpaper/id12840.html,http://www.esocialsciences.org/Download/repecDownload.aspx?fname=A2018622112744_29.pdf&fcategory=Articles&AId=12840&fref=repec,RePEc:ess:wpaper:id:12840,"Sakshi Gupta & Ram Singh, 2018.

The finding arrived is that the ratio of Cash holding to Nominal GDP does not have a statistically significant association with tax GDP ratio, but has the same with government spending. The empirical examination of data leads to a hypothesis that the monetarist approach of taking cash holding as a proxy for either tax evasion or impeding tax effort does not seem to hold good in the Indian context.

It ask, if investors with direct exposure to stock market fraud (treated investors) are more likely to cash out of the stock market than investors with no direct exposure to fraud (control investors)? Using daily investor account holdings data from the National Stock Depository Limited (NSDL), the largest depository in India, It finds that treated investors cash out almost 10.6 percentage points of their overall portfolio relative to control investors post the crisis. The cashing out is largely restricted to the bad stock. Over the period of a month, there is no difference in the trading behaviour of the treated and control investors.

The paper finds robust evidence that median shipping times increase trade costs by a substantial amount. The evidence for uncertainty, as measured by the standard deviation of shipment time, is contrary to expectations, likely due to problems recording data on the ground. It also analyzes the determinants of shipping times and finds that geographical distance is the most reliable indicator of median time and uncertainty, with logistics performance, as measured by the World Bank's Logistics Performance Index, also playing a role in determining shipment times.

,The Morbidity Cost of Air Pollution: Evidence from Consumer Spending in China,"Panle Jia Barwick, Shanjun Li, Deyu Rao, Nahim Bin Zahur","This paper provides knowledge the first analysis of the morbidity cost of PM2.5 for the entire population of a developing country. To address potential endogeneity in pollution exposure, it constructs an instrumental variable by modeling the spatial spillovers of PM2.5 due to long-range transport. It proposes a flexible distributed-lag model that incorporates the IV approach to capture the dynamic response to past pollution exposure. The analysis shows that PM2.5 has a significant impact on healthcare spending in both the short and medium terms that survives an array of robustness checks. The annual reduction in national healthcare spending from complying with the World Health Organization's annual standard of 10 mg/m3 would amount to $42 billion, or nearly 7% of China's total healthcare spending in 2015. In contrast to the common perception that the morbidity impact is modest relative to the mortality impact, our estimated morbidity cost of air pollution is about two-thirds of the mortality cost from the recent literature.","eSS, knowledge, World Health Organization (WHO, morbidity cost, pollution exposure, instrumental, variables, population, health care spending, national health casre spending, mortality, China., All these keywords",https://ideas.repec.org/p/ess/wpaper/id12825.html,http://www.esocialsciences.org/Download/repecDownload.aspx?fname=A2018612154430_29.pdf&fcategory=Articles&AId=12825&fref=repec,RePEc:ess:wpaper:id:12825,"Panle Jia Barwick & Shanjun Li & Deyu Rao & Nahim Bin Zahur, 2018.

,"Market Integration, Demand and the Growth of Firms: Evidence from a Natural Experiment in India","Robert T. Jensen, Nolan H. Miller","In many developing countries, the average firm is small, does not grow and has low productivity. Lack of market integration and limited information on non-local products often leave consumers unaware of the prices and quality of non-local firms. They therefore mostly buy locally, limiting firms' potential market size (and competition). The paper explores this hypothesis using a natural experiment in the Kerala boat-building industry. As consumers learn more about non-local builders, high quality builders gain market share and grow, while low quality firms exit. Aggregate quality increases, as does labor specialization, and average production costs decrease. Finally, quality-adjusted consumer prices decline.","eSS, market integration, growth of firms, demand, natural experiment, low productivity, developing countries, information, non-local products, consumers, prices, quality of non-local firms, potential market, competition, Kerala boat-building industry, high quality builders, labor specialization, average production., All these keywords",https://ideas.repec.org/p/ess/wpaper/id12824.html,http://www.esocialsciences.org/Download/repecDownload.aspx?fname=A2018612153233_29.pdf&fcategory=Articles&AId=12824&fref=repec,RePEc:ess:wpaper:id:12824,"Robert T.

,Empirical Analysis of Factors Influencing Price of Solar Modules,"Farhad Taghizadeh-Hesary, Naoyuki Yoshino, Yugo Inagaki","The solar energy market has seen huge growth in recent years with a vast increase in solar cumulative capacity worldwide. One of the key drivers behind this growth is the decline in solar module prices. Thus, the price reduction mechanism in solar modules has become an important topic as the role of solar electricity in the overall energy supply and the market value of solar modules grow globally. Many empirical analyses have been carried out to unveil the mechanism behind this price reduction. However, the researches performed on the price reduction mechanism of solar modules over the years have focused purely on the technological aspect of the manufacturing. When analyzing price, the influence of economic factors such as interest rate and exchange rate must also be taken into consideration to achieve a precise analysis.

The vector error correction model that develops in this research, shows that increase in money stock (m1) through quantitative easing (QE) and quantitative and qualitative easing (QQE) policies of the BOJ significantly increases the income inequality. On the contrary, Japanese tax policy was effective in reducing the income inequality.

,Assessing the Effectiveness of IMF Programs Following the Global Financial Crisis: How Did It Change Since the Asian Crisis?,"Carlos De Resende, Shinji Takagi","The paper identifies key features of International Monetary Fund (IMF)-supported programs following the 2008 global financial crisis. The statistical analysis of a large sample of countries that borrowed from the IMF during 1997-2013 indicates that, compared to the amount of financing provided to crisis countries during the post-Asian crisis period, the amount was larger on average by more than 3 percentage points of GDP. Yet, the observed magnitude of adjustment in key macroeconomic variables, such as output, the exchange rate, and the current account balance, was just as large, even when the influence of less favorable global economic conditions was controlled for. The paper argues that the puzzle can be explained, in part, by the large-scale global financial deleveraging, as well as the large initial domestic imbalances observed during the post-global crisis period. The IMF's post-global crisis programs routinely allowed fiscal balance targets to be relaxed in the face of adverse shocks; some attempted to bail in private investors or accommodated the use of capital and exchange controls to limit capital outflows; and the IMF often collaborated with other donors to boost total official financing. It is reasonable to surmise that, without these innovations, the required macroeconomic adjustments would have been even greater.","Asian financial crisis, global financial crisis, IMF programs, International Monetary Fund (IMF), post-Asian crisis period, macroeconomic variables, exchange rate, GDP, global economic conditions, post-global crisis period., All these keywords",https://ideas.repec.org/p/ess/wpaper/id12819.html,http://www.esocialsciences.org/Download/repecDownload.aspx?fname=A20186914401_29.pdf&fcategory=Articles&AId=12819&fref=repec,RePEc:ess:wpaper:id:12819,"Carlos De Resende & Shinji Takagi, 2018.

,Cross- Border Portfolio Investment and Financial Integration in Asia and the Pacific Region,"Sayuri Shirai, Eric Alexander Sugandi","This paper examines the developments of cross-border portfolio assets and liabilities in the Asia and Pacific region over the periods of 2001-2017. Rapid increases in both portfolio foreign assets and liabilities have taken place particularly after the 2008-2009 global financial crisis. These cross-border portfolio investments have the following characteristics. First, equity has been a dominant source of foreign liabilities notwithstanding efforts to develop bond markets in the region. One exception is Australia, where foreign liabilities have been largely in the form of debt securities. Limited capital inflows to debt securities issued by emerging Asia may be attributable to the early stages of bond market development. Second, in contrast, debt securities have remained dominant as foreign assets held by the region.","portfolio investment, financial market integration, Asia and the Pacific, financial integration, market, assets, liabilities, foreign assets, foreign liabilities, bond markets, debt securities, capital inflows, bond market development., All these keywords",https://ideas.repec.org/p/ess/wpaper/id12817.html,http://www.esocialsciences.org/Download/repecDownload.aspx?fname=A20186713598_29.pdf&fcategory=Articles&AId=12817&fref=repec,RePEc:ess:wpaper:id:12817,"Sayuri Shirai & Eric Alexander Sugandi, 2018.

,"Financial Inclusion, Regulation, Financial Literacy and Financial Education in Armenia","Armen Nurbekyan, Naneh Hovanessian","Financial inclusion has significantly advanced in Armenia during the last decade. Rural and urban areas, however, have benefited unevenly. The high cost of providing financial services, the lack of physical infrastructure, higher poverty rates, and the low level of financial literacy are the main barriers to financial inclusion in the rural areas. The availability of, and the high level of trust in, postal services in all villages, along with innovative technologies, should be exploited to address the inadequate physical infrastructure. Insurance services, in particular health and agriculture insurance, have a high growth potential. Mandatory health insurance along with an e-health infrastructure can boost high-quality financial inclusion. Targeted financial education policies addressing the most vulnerable groups, in particular the rural population and the unemployed, will significantly increase the quality of financial inclusion. Addressing data gaps, especially in the SME sector, should be a priority for policy makers. Overall, a clear separation of strategies for financial inclusion from the National Strategy for Financial Education clarifying quantitative goals and policies will be beneficial.","eSS, financial inclusion, financial literacy, regulation, Armenia, financial education, rural areas, urban areas, financial services, poverty rates, trust, postal services, innovative technology, physical infrastructure, insurance services, health, agricultural insurance, health insurance, e-health infrastructure, financial education policies, data gaps, policy makers, SME sector, National Strategy for Financial Education clarifying quantitative goals, All these keywords",https://ideas.repec.org/p/ess/wpaper/id12815.html,http://www.esocialsciences.org/Download/repecDownload.aspx?fname=A201867134359_29.pdf&fcategory=Articles&AId=12815&fref=repec,RePEc:ess:wpaper:id:12815,"Armen Nurbekyan & Naneh Hovanessian, 2018.

,Young Enterprises and Bank Credit Denials,Danilo V. Mascia,"By employing a sample of 20,956 observations of non-financial SMEs headquartered in the Euro area, between 2009 and 2015, the paper tests whether young businesses are more likely to face credit rejections from lenders than their older peers. The findings appear to confirm our suspicions that new enterprises consistently experience higher denials from banks compared to more established businesses. Such a result is stable to different model specifications and is also confirmed once it handles the issue of sample selection bias potentially affecting our data. Additional tests also reveal that credit constraints are particularly difficult for young SMEs located in Southern and Central Europe, as well as for those operating in the ""Trade"" industry. Overall, our evidence suggests that actions from the policy maker could be desirable to support the viability of credit and, thus, ensure the growth of young businesses in the Euro area.","eSS, SMEs, young enterprises, bank loans, credit rationing, non-financial, credit rejections, model specifications, higher denials, bank credit denials, sample selection, trade, industry, policy makers, credit, Euro area., All these keywords",https://ideas.repec.org/p/ess/wpaper/id12814.html,http://www.esocialsciences.org/Download/repecDownload.aspx?fname=A201866202839_29.pdf&fcategory=Articles&AId=12814&fref=repec,RePEc:ess:wpaper:id:12814,"Danilo V.

,Constructing the Asia-Pacific Regional Cooperation and Integration Index: A Panel Approach,"Cyn-Young Park, Racquel Claveria","This paper proposes a panel approach in the construction of the Asia-Pacific Regional Cooperation and Integration Index (ARCII) to strengthen the index's ability to track the progress of economic integration in the region over time. Panel-based procedures are employed in imputing missing values, normalizing raw data, and deriving dimensional and subdimensional weights via principal components analysis. Findings suggest the pace of integration in Asia was broadly steady over the 11-year sample period (2006-2016). However, modest gains have been made as a majority of economies in the sample have moved up in their levels of regional integration from 2006 to 2016. Of the six dimensions featured in the ARCII, trade and investment and movement of people are the main drivers of regional integration, while the money and finance dimension was the weakest link. Based on global normalization, Asia comes second to the European Union (EU) in progress on regional integration, but in recent years a few Asian economies have broken through to the top tier dominated by the EU economies.","eSS, Asia, composite index, regional integration, Asia-Pacific Regional Cooperation and Integration Index (ARCII), Panel-based procedures, Panel Principal Component Analysis-Derived Weights, Normalization, Imputation of Missing Data, Weighting, Aggregation, Dimensional Subindexes over Time, Regional Integration., All these keywords",https://ideas.repec.org/p/ess/wpaper/id12813.html,http://www.esocialsciences.org/Download/repecDownload.aspx?fname=A201866202041_29.pdf&fcategory=Articles&AId=12813&fref=repec,RePEc:ess:wpaper:id:12813,"Cyn-Young Park & Racquel Claveria, 2018.

,Estimating Elasticity of Transport Fuel Demand in Pakistan,Muhammad Omer,"This study investigates the fuel demand elasticities separately for petrol, diesel, and CNG using data from July 2004 to June 2015 for Pakistan. The results show that fuel demands are generally (own and cross price) inelastic in the short run, but are relatively elastic in the long run. Though these short run estimates are in line with the literature, the long run estimates differ considerably. Administrative intervention in fuel pricing, load management in CNG sector and its close to perfect substitutability with petrol is driving this long run price elasticity result. Moreover, income elasticity estimates suggest that petrol is a normal good while diesel and CNG are inferior goods. The estimates remain robust when lag demands of substitutes, the exchange rate, and real fuel prices are separately included in the model.

,Adjustment to Trade Opening: The Case of Labor Share in India's Manufacturing Industry,"Prachi Gupta, Matthias Helble","This paper is to studies how manufacturing plants in India adjusted to trade liberalization during the period 1998-99 to 2007-08. It estimates how the labor share changed due to tariff reduction. The results indicate that a decline in output tariffs led to an increase in the labor share of income. In contrast, a fall in input tariffs led to a decrease in the labor share. Controlling for factor intensity, it finds that in technology intensive and human capital resource intensive sectors, both a decline in input and output tariff rates led to a decline in labor share. A fall in tariffs only led to an increase in labor share for labor intensive and low-technology plants. Hence, India's bias towards capital and technology intensive production explains the overall decline in labor share in the post reform period. Furthermore, the empirical results show that labor adjustment occurred more efficiently in Indian states with flexible labor laws.","trade reforms, labor share, India, manufacturing, capital, technology intensive production, labor share, labor laws, human capital, trade liberalization, output tariff, tariff reduction., All these keywords",https://ideas.repec.org/p/ess/wpaper/id12810.html,http://www.esocialsciences.org/Download/repecDownload.aspx?fname=A20186517053_29.pdf&fcategory=Articles&AId=12810&fref=repec,RePEc:ess:wpaper:id:12810,"Prachi Gupta & Matthias Helble, 2018.

,Task Force On Improving Employment Data - A Critique,T.N. Srinivasan,"The absence of reliable data on employment was well known in India. For ensuring that the sample sizes for its estimates from its annual employment and unemployment survey (EUS) were adequate, the National Sample Survey Office (NSSO) had instituted since 1 980s the so called `thick' rounds of EUS with large samples, while the annual so called`thin' rounds with small samples continued. In addition to the EUS surveys the NSSO also canvassed the so called enterprise surveys with ownership, rather than household, as the basic unit of record. There were other surveys which provided estimates of Employment and Unemployment. On 11 May 2017 the Ministry of Labour Employment set up a Task Force for Improving Employment data (DGE_-Z_-13011/08/2017-MP(G)). The Task Force submitted its report and invited comments from the public on it by July 23, 2017.

The objective is to find out the changes which have taken place in different labour characteristics over time. It is important as all employed persons are not homogeneous and an y change over time in its characteristics has its effect on its marginal product and hence on productivit y and growth of GDP.

Given the multifaceted intersections of caste and gender in shaping inequalities in other indicators such as childhood mortality, reported preference for sons and labour market outcomes, we examine the variations in nutritional status of children across the intersections of the two axes, sex and caste. This is a methodological paper, attempting to illustrate the various quantitative methods that have been used (with or without adhering to the term 'intersectionality') or may be used to capture intersectional inequalities.","Intersectionality, Gender, Caste, Child Undernutrition, sex, caste, quantitative, qualitative, All these keywords",https://ideas.repec.org/p/ess/wpaper/id12787.html,http://www.esocialsciences.org/Download/repecDownload.aspx?fname=A2018528134149_20.pdf&fcategory=Articles&AId=12787&fref=repec,RePEc:ess:wpaper:id:12787,"Simantini Mukhopadhyay & Achin Chakraborty, 2018.

Through an extensive review of existing literature and several rounds of nationally representative household survey data, we document the evolution of mechanization (particularly tractors and combine harvesters) in Vietnam, including the heterogeneity across regions and farm sizes, and the emerging roles of the private sector in the supply of machinery and hiring services. The historical growth pattern of mechanization in Vietnam had been non-linear, characterized by somewhat high tractor-use prior to 1975 followed by a decline in the 80s before a resurgence in the 90s, with considerable variations in adoption patterns across regions.","mechanization, mechanization growth, tractors, combine-harvesters, hiring service providers, Vietnam, regions, non-linear, tractor-use, machinery, hiring services, private sector, All these keywords",https://ideas.repec.org/p/ess/wpaper/id12785.html,http://www.esocialsciences.org/Download/repecDownload.aspx?fname=A2018528123618_20.pdf&fcategory=Articles&AId=12785&fref=repec,RePEc:ess:wpaper:id:12785,"Hiroyuki Takeshima & Yanyan Liu & Ian Masias, 2018.

The paper questions that assumption on theoretical and empirical grounds and finds that prominent stylized facts about global inequality are not robust. At one extreme, theories of relative deprivation yield a nationalistic measure whereby global inequality is average within-country inequality, which is rising. Other theories and evidence point instead to an intrinsic value to living in a richer country. Then parameter values consistent with subjective wellbeing imply far higher global inequality than prevailing measures, though falling since 1990.","Income, life expectancy, Inequality, growth, global, All these keywords",https://ideas.repec.org/p/ess/wpaper/id12779.html,http://www.esocialsciences.org/Articles/show_Article.aspx?acat=InstitutionalPapers&aid=12779,RePEc:ess:wpaper:id:12779,"Martin Ravallion, 2018.

,Examining the state level heterogeneity of public health expenditure in Indi a: an empirical evidence from panel data,Deepak Kumar Behera,"This study explores the relationship over an extended period of time between an increase in per capita public health expenditure and per capita state's domestic product (per capita income) of 16 states of India from 1980 to 2014. We consider eight panels of states based on geographical region and levels of economic development for examining the level of heterogeneity in the share of public health expenditure with respect to states' domestic product by using panel unit root, panel co-integration and panel Granger causality techniques. The empirical result shows that public health expenditure and states' domestic product are co-integrated in the long-run. The result also shows a positive and significant effect of per capita income in the growth of public health expenditure in the long-run. It finds that there is a bi-directional Granger causality between per capita income and public health expenditure in the short-run while the causality is unidirectional in the long -run. The overall result implies the existence of inequalities in the share of government health expenditure with respect to state's level of economic development in India. This study would offer effective fiscal policy instruments to minimising geographical inequity of health finance for achieving universal health coverage of Indian states.","public health expenditure, PHE, Indian states, heterogeneity, panel data, universal health coverage, UHC Westerlund co-integr ation, VECM Granger causality, All these keywords",https://ideas.repec.org/p/ess/wpaper/id12778.html,http://www.esocialsciences.org/Articles/show_Article.aspx?acat=InstitutionalPapers&aid=12778,RePEc:ess:wpaper:id:12778,"Deepak Kumar Behera, 2018.

Using panel dataset of 49 m ajors industries of Indian manufacturing sector for the period 2003 - 04 to 2010 - 11 and applying the system GMM approach to estimate of dynamic panel data models, the paper finds that vertical integration does not cause any significant impact on average mark et power of firms in an industry. Instead, it is influenced by market size, and selling and technology related efforts. While selling intensity has a positive impact on market power, the impact of market size and technology intensity is found to be negativ e. Notably, like vertical integration, market concentration, import to export ratio, and capital intensity also do not have any significant impact on market power. The findings of this paper, therefore, have important implications for competition law and p olicy in general and policies and regulation relating to technology development and international trade in particular.","Economic Reforms, Vertical Integration, Market Power, Competition Policy, India, All these keywords",https://ideas.repec.org/p/ess/wpaper/id12776.html,http://www.esocialsciences.org/Articles/show_Article.aspx?acat=WorkingPapers&aid=12776,RePEc:ess:wpaper:id:12776,"Pulak Mishra & Rakesh Basant, 2018.

,Gender and Intersecting Inequalities in Local Government in South Asia,Sohela Nazneen,"This paper is an evidence review of how intersecting forms of inequalities influence women's political participation and representation at the local level in Bangladesh, India and Pakistan. The review shows that while the quota system has increased women's presence in local government, inter sections of gender and caste or gender and class affect minority women's ability to contest elections, participate in local government meetings, contest opinions, and represent the interests of their community and that of gender equality in different ways. These intersections also make women vulnerable to discriminatory practices within the government and also to violence. How effectively minority women are able to tackle discriminatory practices is influenced by the nature of patriarchy, the history of women's engagement in local level institutions, women's involvement in political mobilisations and engagement of women's organisations on these issues. The paper also identifies research, policy and programme gaps on intersectional identities and women' political participation.","local government, South Asia, intersectionality, gender quota, minority women's participation, women's political empowerment, India, Bangladesh, Pakistan, All these keywords",https://ideas.repec.org/p/ess/wpaper/id12772.html,http://www.esocialsciences.org/Articles/show_Article.aspx?acat=InstitutionalPapers&aid=12772,RePEc:ess:wpaper:id:12772,"Sohela Nazneen, 2018.

,The impact of macroeconomic policies on the growth of public health expenditure: An empirical assessment from the Indian states,"Umakant Dash, Deepak Kumar Behera","The impact assessment of macroeconomic policies on public health expenditure is very relevant in Indian economy because of tax reform, fiscal consoli- dation, and expenditure policy reform. These have been undertaken after economic liberalization in order to sustain a high economic growth. Despite the several fis- cal policy initiatives, there is a persistent slowing down of growth in public health expenditure and a huge disparity in the allocation of budget toward health care among the Indian states. Using the period 1990-2014, the study examines the dynamic relationships between public health expenditure and macroeconomic fac- tors (economic growth, domestic revenue, domestic debt, fiscal balance, and central government transfer) of 15 major states of India. Our empirical result shows that state's revenue (i.e. tax revenue and indirect tax) and central transfer (i.e. tax devo- lution) are the major public providers for financing the health care of Indian states. Other sources of revenue of the government, namely non-tax revenue and direct tax show no impact on public health expenditure in the short run, while it shows a positive impact in the long run. As a consequence, we find that economic growth and fiscal balance lead to a favorable impact on public health expenditure in the long run. The result suggests the improvement in revenue collection, increase in the tax base and the efficient utilization of central grants would generate fiscal space in the economy, and thereby the government can allocate more funds toward public health care.","public health expenditure, economic growth, fiscal space, tax revenue, fiscal balance, domestic debt, central grants, economic liberalization, Indian states, Indian economy, All these keywords",https://ideas.repec.org/p/ess/wpaper/id12771.html,http://www.esocialsciences.org/Articles/show_Article.aspx?acat=InstitutionalPapers&aid=12771,RePEc:ess:wpaper:id:12771,"Umakant Dash & Deepak Kumar Behera, 2018.

,FDI in Services and India,"Tanu M Goyal, Arpita Mukherjee","Developing countries, including India, are increasing relying on foreign direct investments (FDI) for raising finance for infrastructure development and other projects. Consequently, countries are undertaking policy reforms for facilitating investment flows. In India, services sector is the largest recipient of inward and outward FDI since liberalization. Yet, India continues to face certain challenges to both inward and outward foreign investments as a result of which, it has not been able to exploit its full potential. This article studies the trends and patterns in India's inward and outward investment flows and analyzes its international agree - ments to examine the degree of openness across different services sector, assess barriers and suggest reforms. The article uses the Fink and Molinuevo (2008) framework to examine the architectural design of India's trade agreements and their level of openness in investment in services. The article found that despite progressive liberalization, India continues to impose operating restrictions and regulatory barriers on foreign investors. India is not willing to take forward- looking commitments in investment in services and bind the autonomous regime. The article suggests that FDI is a 'market access' issue and it should be delinked from domestic regulation. Domestic regulation should not discriminate between foreign and domestic investors.","FDI, services, India, trade agreements, policy, All these keywords",https://ideas.repec.org/p/ess/wpaper/id12769.html,http://www.esocialsciences.org/Articles/show_Article.aspx?acat=InstitutionalPapers&aid=12769,RePEc:ess:wpaper:id:12769,"Tanu M Goyal & Arpita Mukherjee, 2018.

,Growth and Childbearing in the Short- and Long-Run,"Tom Vogl, Shoumitro Chatterjee","Despite being key to theories of economic growth and the demographic transition, evidence on how fertility responds to aggregate income change is mixed. We analyze economic growth and fertility change in the developing world over six decades, using data on 2.3 million women from 255 surveys in 81 countries. We find that fertility responds differently to fluctuations and long-run growth, and the nature of these responses varies over the lifecycle. Fertility is procyclical, falling during recessions, but also declines and delays with long-run growth. Lifetime fertility is affected by fluctuations near the end of the reproductive period but not those at prime reproductive age. Our results are consistent with models linking demography, human capital, and long-run growth, extended to include a lifecycle with liquidity constraints.","Macroeconomics, fertility, growth, lifecycle, human capital, demography, All these keywords",https://ideas.repec.org/p/ess/wpaper/id12766.html,http://www.esocialsciences.org/Articles/show_Article.aspx?acat=InstitutionalPapers&aid=12766,RePEc:ess:wpaper:id:12766,"Tom Vogl & Shoumitro Chatterjee, 2018.

,Goods and Services Tax (GST),Parthasarathi Shome,"India introduced the Goods and Services Tax (GST) on 1 July 2017 after a decade of preparation. Ideally, GST should reduce tax driving the market by enabling businesses to invest, reflecting consumer choices rather than through strategising against the tax structure. The basic GST structure poses challenges. It differentiates between goods and services contrary to GST's essence. Too many rates contest the desirable single- or double-rate structure. There is wide variation among rates. Too many taxpayers have been brought in from the bottom, which will challenge the tax administration adversely. Registration is required in every state where a dealer is trading. This enables the central administration and that of each state to scrutinise the same taxpayer, but comprises a compliance challenge for small taxpayers. Going forward, teething problems in information technology affecting filing of returns should be corrected. There is no monitoring cell to check the GST's impact on revenue or inflation. GST was intended to be introduced on a revenue-neutral basis. The possibility of reduction in GST rates should be considered if post-introduction revenue has shifted up the pre- introduction collection trend. There should be no significant short-run adverse impact on GDP if cascading elements of the earlier tax structure are reduced under GST. These matters need monitoring and correction. Petroleum has to be brought in the GST base quickly to reduce its cascading effects. Judging from the weekly posts by the Chairperson, CBEC, it is apparent that the top administration is trying to handhold taxpayers, ease compliance, and control remaining elements of corruption.","Goods and Services Ta, Taxpayers, Tax, India, VAT, All these keywords",https://ideas.repec.org/p/ess/wpaper/id12765.html,http://www.esocialsciences.org/Articles/show_Article.aspx?acat=InstitutionalPapers&aid=12765,RePEc:ess:wpaper:id:12765,"Parthasarathi Shome, 2018.

,Crowding-Out or Crowding-In? Public and Private Investment in India,"Girish Bahal, Mehdi Raissi","This paper contributes to the debate on the relationship between public and private investment in India along the following dimensions. First, acknowledging major structural changes that the Indian economy has undergone in the past three decades, we study whether public investment in recent years has become more or less complementary to private investment in comparison to the period before 1980. Second, we construct a novel data-set of quarterly aggregate public and private investment in India over the period 1996-2015 using investment-project data from the CapEx-CMIE database. Third, embedding a theory-driven long-run relationship on the model, we estimate a range of Structural Vector Error Correction Models (SVECMs) to re-examine the public and private investment relationship in India. Identification is achieved by decomposing shocks into those with transitory and permanent effects. Our results suggest that while public investment crowds out private investment in India over the period 1950-2012, the opposite is true when we restrict the sample to post 1980 or conduct a quarterly analysis since 1996. This change can likely be attributed to the policy reforms which started during early 1980s and gained momentum after the 1991 crisis.","India, Public and private investment, Crowding in (out), All these keywords",https://ideas.repec.org/p/ess/wpaper/id12764.html,http://www.esocialsciences.org/Download/repecDownload.aspx?fname=A2018572198_57.pdf&fcategory=Articles&AId=12764&fref=repec,RePEc:ess:wpaper:id:12764,"Girish Bahal & Mehdi Raissi, 2018.

,From Rio to Paris: India in Global Climate Politics,Aniruddh Mohan,"This paper analyses India's participation in more than two decades global climate politics. India has transitioned from a protest voice on the fringes of global climate policy to one that is actively shaping international efforts to combat climate change. Analysis of the drivers behind India's negotiating positions on climate change thus far has focused on the competing motives of equity and co-benefits, which has however been insufficient to explain some of India's recent actions in global climate governance. There is a gap in the literature with regards to the analysis of Indian climate policy as situated in its larger foreign policy agenda and objectives. This paper studies the evolution of India's climate policy through the perspective of its broader foreign policy strategy, arguing that India's engagement with international climate politics can be better understood by locating its climate policy as a subset of its foreign policy agenda. Shifts in India's climate change negotiation stance in the past decade have been but a part of its overall foreign policy adjustments in favour of greater responsibility in management of the global commons. Going for ward, tracking Indian foreign policy objectives will yield vital clues towards India's role in global climate action.","Climate change, India, foeign policy, Rio, Paris, All these keywords",https://ideas.repec.org/p/ess/wpaper/id12763.html,http://www.esocialsciences.org/Articles/show_Article.aspx?acat=InstitutionalPapers&aid=12763,RePEc:ess:wpaper:id:12763,"Aniruddh Mohan, 2018.

,Demographics and FDI: Lessons from China's One-Child Policy,"Rajnish Mehra, Christos Koulovatianos, John Donaldson","Lucas (1990) argues that the neoclassical adjustment process fails to explain the relative paucity of FDI inflows from rich to poor countries. In this paper we consider a natural experiment: using China as the treated country and India as the control, we show that the dynamics of the relative FDI flows subsequent to the implementation of China's one-child policy, as seen in the data, are consistent with neoclassical fundamentals. In particular, following the introduction of the one-child policy in China, the capital-labor (K/L) ratio of China increased relative to that of India, and, simultaneously, relative FDI inflows into China vs. India declined. These observations are explained in the context of a simple neoclassical OLG paradigm. The adjustment mechanism works as follows: the reduction in the (urban) labor force due to the one-child policy increases the savings per capita. This increases the K/L ratio and reduces the marginal product of capital (MPK). The reduction in MPK (relative to India) reduces the relative attractiveness of investment in China and is thus associated with lower FDI/GDP ratios. Our paper contributes to the nascent literature exploring demographic transitions and their effects on FDI flows.","Lucas paradox, capital-labor ratio, FDI-intensity, one-child policy, All these keywords",https://ideas.repec.org/p/ess/wpaper/id12759.html,http://www.esocialsciences.org/Download/repecDownload.aspx?fname=A201852153413_57.pdf&fcategory=Articles&AId=12759&fref=repec,RePEc:ess:wpaper:id:12759,"Rajnish Mehra & Christos Koulovatianos & John Donaldson, 2018.

The analysis is pursued at three levels of disaggregation: states, districts and the million-plus cities. At the state level, urbanization does not show any significant impact on rural poverty though it tends to reduce poverty in the urban areas. Growth influences urbanization positively, while urbanization and expansion in non - agricul tural activities both contribute to economic growth. An alternative technique again shows a strong association between urbanization and per capita net state domestic product. Although urban inequality is not strongly correlated with urbanization and growth, the relationship is distinct. While poverty tends to decline evidently, inequality rises in the process of growth and urbanization. Further, a positive relationship amongmigration, urbanization and growth index is noticeable. The district-level data confirms a positive association among urbanization, work participation rate, percentage of workforce engaged in non-household manufacturing and services, literacy, growth and inequality,though the degree of association is mild.Urbanization shows a strong beneficial effect on povertyat the district level.","urbanization, growth, poverty, city, workforce, All these keywords",https://ideas.repec.org/p/ess/wpaper/id12758.html,http://www.esocialsciences.org/Articles/show_Article.aspx?acat=InstitutionalPapers&aid=12758,RePEc:ess:wpaper:id:12758,"Arup Mitra, 2018.

,The Impact of New Drug Launches on Life-Years Lost in 2015 from 19 Types of Cancer in 36 Countries,Frank R. Lichtenberg,"This study employs a two-way fixed effects research design to measure the mortality impact and cost-effectiveness of cancer drugs: it analyzes the correlation across 36 countries between relative mortality from 19 types of cancer in 2015 and the relative number of drugs previously launched in that country to treat that type of cancer, controlling for relative incidence. One additional drug for a cancer site launched during 2006-2010 is estimated to have reduced the number of 2015 disability-adjusted life years (DALYs) lost due to cancer at that site by 5.8%. The estimated cost per life-year gained at all ages in 2015 from cancer drugs launched during 2006-2010 is $1635. The paper estimates that drugs launched during the entire 1982-2010 period reduced the number of cancer DALYs lost in 2015 by about 23%. In the absence of new drug launches during 1982-2010, there would have been 26.3 million additional DALYs lost in 2015.","eSS, drug, cancer, DALYs, mortality, cost-effectiveness, cancer drug, relative incidence., All these keywords",https://ideas.repec.org/p/ess/wpaper/id12757.html,http://www.esocialsciences.org/Download/repecDownload.aspx?fname=A201852134946_29.pdf&fcategory=Articles&AId=12757&fref=repec,RePEc:ess:wpaper:id:12757,"Frank R.

,Innovation and Trade Policy in a Globalized World,"Ufuk Akcigit, Sina T. Ates, Giammario Impullitti","How do import tariffs and R&D subsidies help domestic firms compete globally? How do these policies affect aggregate growth and economic welfare? To answer these questions, the paper builds a dynamic general equilibrium growth model where firm innovation endogenously determines the dynamics of technology, and, therefore, market leadership and trade flows, in a world with two large open economies at different stages of development. Firms' R&D decisions are driven by (i) the defensive innovation motive, (ii) the expansionary innovation motive, and (iii) technology spillovers. The theoretical investigation illustrates that, statically, globalization (defined as reduced trade barriers) has ambiguous effects on welfare, while, dynamically, intensified globalization boosts domestic innovation through induced international competition.","eSS, innovation, trade policy, globalized world, globalization, competition, economic welfare, growth, equilibrium growth model, technology, leadership, market, markt leadership, defensive innovation motive, domestic innovation, international competition., All these keywords",https://ideas.repec.org/p/ess/wpaper/id12756.html,http://www.esocialsciences.org/Download/repecDownload.aspx?fname=A201852134218_29.pdf&fcategory=Articles&AId=12756&fref=repec,RePEc:ess:wpaper:id:12756,"Ufuk Akcigit & Sina T.

,Labour Regulations in India: Improving the Social Security Framework,"Anwarul Hoda, Durgesh Rai","An important segment of labour regulations concerns the protection aspects of social security. These regulations provide safety nets or fall back mechanisms to enable workers to cope with crises that affect households from time to time, such as illness, employment injury, death or old age. This paper critically reviews and analyses existing regulations in India that provide fall back mechanisms and evaluates how theycompare with systems in selected comparator countries and measure up against the minimum standards recommended in various ILO Conventions. These regulations are important not only from the point of view of the welfare of society but also from the perspective of efficiency of the work force in any activity. The analysis reveals serious shortcomings in the social security legislation and programmes in the country insofar as they apply to the unorganised workers.

In doing so, we analyze the provisions in the relevant ILO Conventions and look at the laws and practice in selected developed and emerging countries, and in particular in five comparator countries, which have been successful in industrial development, viz., China, Japan, Malaysia, South Korea and Thailand. The study shows that the wage regulations in India do not measure up to the standards adopted in peer countries and in some respect fall short of the recommendations in ILO Conventions.

We use a novel instrumental variable, agroclimatic similarity between farmers' and plant breeding institutes' locations, to instrument the adoption of improved seed varieties.

,Solid Waste Management in India An Assessment of Resource Recovery and Environmental Impact,"Utkarsh Patel, Isher Judge Ahluwalia","This study analyses the environmental and financial sustainability of solid waste management in Indian cities. It presents an assessment of the rapidly rising volume of municipal solid waste, its changing composition, the continuing practice of mixing biod egradable (wet) waste with dry waste at the source of generation, and the growing volume of plastic in the waste. The present system is focussed on collection and transportation of largely mixed unsegregated waste. Resource recovery from the waste and safe disposal of the residual waste in scientifically designed landfills are grossly neglected. Rules have now been put in place for sustainable solid waste management, but the capacity to plan and manage the system and ensure the enforcement of the rules is a major challenge. The inability to ensure segregation of waste comes in the way of proper recycling, effective functioning of biomethanation plants, and also of safe operation of waste to energy plants which consequently leads to release of toxic pollutan ts into the atmosphere. Sites allocated for landfills are used as open dumping sites where far too much waste is dumped without resource recovery, generating leachate and methane gas. This study also presents the sources of greenhouse gas emissions from t he solid waste sector. Besides presenting some mitigation choices to respond to the growing challenge, it also suggests mechanisms for ensuring that the system is financially sustainable .","Solid Waste Management, Greenhouse Gas Emissions from Solid Waste Sector, Sustainable Materials Management, Waste to Energy, All these keywords",https://ideas.repec.org/p/ess/wpaper/id12746.html,http://www.esocialsciences.org/Articles/show_Article.aspx?acat=InstitutionalPapers&aid=12746,RePEc:ess:wpaper:id:12746,"Utkarsh Patel & Isher Judge Ahluwalia, 2018.

,India and Trade Facilitation in Services (TFS) Agreement: Concerns and Way Forward,"Avantika Kapoor, Arpita Mukherjee","Services are a major component of global gross domestic product and employment, and a rising component of global trade and investment flows. This is the largest sector of the Indian economy contributing significantly to economic growth and foreign investment flows. India is among the top ten W orld T rade O rganization member countries in trade in services, and the country has a positive trade balance in services. However, global trade in services faces a number of barriers at the border and behind the border, which makes it difficult for service providers from developing countries such as India to access key markets in their preferred modes of services trade. Given this background, this paper examines how trade in services can be liberalised within the WTO framework. It presents some of the recent estimates of trade costs related to barriers to trade in services, and examines why it is difficult to mea sure trade facilitation in services. It then examines India's proposal on Trade Facilitation in Services (TFS), highlighting the benefits, gaps in the proposal, issues and way forward.

,"Implementation of the POCSO Act: Goals, Gaps and Challenges",Bharti Ali,"The study comes at a crucial time when key actors as well as the general public would like to know more about how effective is the implementation of the main law protecting children from sexual abuse. The study further confirms that a large majority of perpetrators of sexual offences against children are known to the victim, and that a large majority of the victims are girls. In an interesting development, the study analyses the low incidence of reported cases of sexual abuse against boys. Far from being uncommon, social attitudes may result in sexual offences against boys not being perceived and treated with the seriousness it deserves. In this context, it is imperative to conduct a careful and continuous analysis of the obstacles to the reporting of sexual abuse by children as well as of the implications of compulsory reporting in light of their best interest. It is essential to understand the specific obstacles boys and girls may face when reporting sexual abuse from people known to them and the tremendous social stigma and feelings of shame and guilt that most of the victims experience. The lack of required support to the victims, once a case is reported, in terms of legal representation and appointment of a support person raises important questions about the responsiveness of the justice system in sensitive sexual abuse cases.

In this paper, we examine the impact of technology on employment and skill demand within the Indian manufacturing sector. Estimating a dynamic labour demand equation, we find that that despite reducing the required labour per unit of output, technology has not reduced the aggregate employment in the Indian manufacturing sector. However, qualitative effect of technology on lab our demand has been very significant. Our results show that adoption of new technology has increased the demand for high skilled workers at the cost of intermediary skills, leading to the polarization of manufacturing jobs.

,ICT Investments and Growth of Small and Medium Firms: A Study of Food Processing Industry in India,"Navyashree G. R., Savita Bhat","Small and medium enterprises (SMEs) cover a wide range of industries and play a major role in both developed and developing economies. They are considered as significant sources of entrepreneurship. Information and communication technology (ICT) is a gener al purpose technology that can help these firms in improving their operations, and thereby positively affecting their growth and competitiveness. However, there are hardly any empirical studies that have analyzed the effect of adoption of ICT on the perfor mance of SMEs. Hence, the objective of the present study is to examine the effect of ICT investments on the sales growth of SMEs from the food processing industry in India. Secondary data is collected from the Prowess database provided by Centre for Monitoring Indian Economy (CMIE) for the period of five years from 2010 to 2014. Panel data regression technique is used for the analysis. The result shows that ICT investments in the previous year has a favorable effect on the sales growth of SMEs. Other variab les like size of the firm and age of the firm are also statistically important in explaining sales growth of SMEs in the food processing industry.","small and medium enterprises, liberalization, globalization, privatization, deregulation, information and communication technologies, All these keywords",https://ideas.repec.org/p/ess/wpaper/id12731.html,http://www.esocialsciences.org/Download/repecDownload.aspx?fname=A2018419235440_57.pdf&fcategory=Articles&AId=12731&fref=repec,RePEc:ess:wpaper:id:12731,"Navyashree G.

The interest and use of solar energy is as old as mankind. However, the modern solar industry t ruly started in the fifties, with the discovery of a practical way to make electricity from light, with silicon that could make a photovoltaic material. Photovoltaics is now clearly to become the number one of renewable electrical energy sources in the wor ld. The most striking trend from 2000 to now has been the rise of China, at present the world's largest. Now, the shift is back to the US, Europe and ""sunny countries"" , in the developing world. More and more companies are getting into solar, all over the world. Solar energy is the key issue for the 1.5 billion people still living without any electricity at all. Hence the major trends are: New technologies, cheaper and more efficient , new formats Many more players worldwide China dominance changing Solar energy is clearly the future.

,Unfinished Lives: The effect of Domestic Violence on Neonatal and Infant Mortality,Seetha Menon,"India accounts for 1.7 million child deaths, a quarter of global child mortality. The current literature has succeeded in establishing an association between domestic violence and child mortality, but has yet to present evidence of a causal relationship. In this paper we use an instrumental variable approach to analyse the causal impact of domestic violence against the mother on child mortality in the Indian context. Domestic violence is instrumented with the real price of gold at the month of marriage of the mother. Results lend evidence to a bias in OLS estimates and show a significant positive relationship between domestic violence and mortality. A one standard deviation increase in domestic violence translates to a 7.2 and 8.7 percentage point increase in both neonatal and infant mortality respectively.","domestic violence, dowry, instrumental variable, All these keywords",https://ideas.repec.org/p/ess/wpaper/id12727.html,http://www.esocialsciences.org/Download/repecDownload.aspx?fname=www.sole-jole.org/2015Menon.pdf&fcategory=Articles&AId=12727&fref=repec,RePEc:ess:wpaper:id:12727,"Seetha Menon, 2018.

These applications have come as a result of a notification that the Environment Ministry had passed on March 14th 2017 which gives an opportunity to projects that have violated conditions of the EIA Notification to apply for a clearance within a period of six months, ie by September 15. This notification was passed despite much criticism of the draft notification that was issued on 10 May 2016. The CPR-Namati Environmental Justice Program has analysed these applications to see what are the kind of geographical and sectorial spread of these violations and whether there are any trends emerging out of the applications that have come in till June 15. The Environment Ministry has already started looking at the applications through a Committee that has been set up for this. This Committee is headed by Dr SR Wate and had its first meeting on 22 June 2017. The Committee in its first meeting has examined ten applications. Out of these ten applications, the committee has already recommended seven for grant for a Terms of Reference subject to conditions.

,Engines without Drivers: Cities in India's Growth Story,Partha Mukhopadhyay,"It is now almost axiomatic that cities are the engines of growth. Historically, federal support programmes have focused on rural areas, but over the past fifteen years, the need to devise such programmes for urban local bodies has come to be recognised, with JNNURM in its various forms, being the most visible early manifestation. This trend has continued, even strengthened, in this government and among the menu of urban support programmes on offer from the Government of India, the vision of the city as the engine of growth is most clearly evident in the Smart City Mission, with its focus on area based development - like an engine within the city. Yet, even in the mainstream economics literature, while there is evidence for cities as places of higher productivity, there is less evidence for cities as drivers of growth - with learning being the primary driver and urban primacy being an important obstacle. The primary questions are whether cities are places of learning, whether there are identifiable mechanisms of such learning and the kind of city institutions - economic, social and political - that facilitate such learning. This paper will interrogate the empirical characteristics of such urban institutions in India in the context of the theoretical literature and learning mechanisms that emerge from international evidence. In particular, it will argue that the nature of the labour market, which is largely contractual, the transfer of rural fragmentation in social relations to cities and the absence of city-level political agency, all reduce the potential of the city as a location of learning economies. For cities to even have the possibility of being engines of growth, we need to ensure that drivers of these engines are in place and we have a mechanism to think about paths to follow.","India.

,Revisiting Rates of Return to Agricultural R&D Investment,"Alejandro Nin Pratt, Eduardo Magalhaes","This study proposes the use of partial least squares to determine the key parameters of the perpetual inventory method model of capital stock as a new approach to calculate research and development (R&D) knowledge stocks and R&D elasticities. This approach avoids most of the major problems encountered in the literature that lead to obtaining very high and implausible rates of return to agricultural R&D...Using this approach, we obtain an average R&D elasticity for low- and middle-income (LM) countries of 0.23 and an average rate of return to R&D investment of 6.0 percent, bigger than the average discount rate of 4.2 percent for these countries. Results show that 60 percent of LM countries in our sample are underinvesting in agricultural R&D, as they can get higher returns by investing in this activity than in activities that return the social discount rate.

,Chronic Poverty in India: Overview Study,Amita Shah,"This paper tries to summarise the current state of knowledge about chronic poverty in India and identify the agenda for further research. An ove rview of the trends in incidence of income poverty in India is provided so as to place chronic poverty in context. It views chronic poverty in terms of severity, extended duration and multidimensional deprivation. It tries to identify the states and regio ns that have a high incidence of people with incomes severely below the poverty line so as to focus attention on areas that are spatial poverty traps. Those unable to access even two square meals a day are considered to be the most severely deprived and hu nger exists even in the supposedly better parts of India. Policy action is needed to address this. Attention is also drawn to the importance of identifying those who are vulnerable to extreme poverty due to inability to absorb the impact of shocks. The i ncidence of chronic poverty in the duration sense is studied on the basis of analysis of panel data sets in the literature. Casual agricultural labourers are the largest group and cultivators the second largest among the chronically poor. The bulk of the chronically poor depend on wages.","Poverty, India, Wages, Income, Nutrition, Deprived, Poor, All these keywords",https://ideas.repec.org/p/ess/wpaper/id12714.html,http://www.esocialsciences.org/Articles/show_Article.aspx?acat=InstitutionalPapers&aid=12714,RePEc:ess:wpaper:id:12714,"Amita Shah, 2018.

,"Mgnregs: Political Economy, Local Governance And Asset Creation In South India",Vinoj Abraham,"MGNREGS, the premier centrally-sponsored national rural livelihood scheme, is one of the most elaborately designed and implemented public workfare programmes in India. While a large number of studies have analysed the progress of employment creation under the scheme, very few have looked into the equally important issue of rural asset creation under the scheme. The scheme is centrally sponsored and the broad guidelines are centrally designed, yet the interpretation and implementation of the scheme is subject to wide regional variation owing to variations in local level governance capacity, governance structure and regional political economy. Evidences based on a primary survey across the four southern states, viz., Andhra Pradesh (erstwhile), Tamil Nadu, Karnataka and Kerala show that the design of the scheme for asset creation is subject to considerably varied interpretations at the regional and sub-regional levels anchored on the above factors. Further, the type of projects selected and created, extent and nature of expenditure incurred, quality of assets created and maintenance of assets were considerably affected by the structures of local governance, the interaction between the political class and the local governments; and the local manifestations of class-caste dynamics.","Local Governance, Rural Employment, Political Economy, All these keywords",https://ideas.repec.org/p/ess/wpaper/id12691.html,http://www.esocialsciences.org/Download/repecDownload.aspx?fname=A201845163924_57.pdf&fcategory=Articles&AId=12691&fref=repec,RePEc:ess:wpaper:id:12691,"Vinoj Abraham, 2018.

,"Informality, Governance and Growth","Dibyendu Maiti, Chandril Bhattacharyya","This paper develops a growth framework of a typical developing and democratic setting with formal and informal sectors, which faces trade-off of redistribution through either direct subsidy or strategic regulatory concession to operate informal activities. Inverted U-shaped growth and welfare functions against governance are found, which suggests a deliberated weak governance can raise growth and welfare of the economy with large informal sector keeping taxation at lower level. The governance that maximises growth varies inversely with subsidy given to informal sector and formal labour bargaining power. Unlike the level maximising welfare, the governance that maximises growth becomes independent of the bargaining power in case of no subsidy. Using standard parameters, the calibrated growth and welfare functions support these relations. Econometric results derived from instrumental and system regression models using pooled data for 46 countries during 1995-2009 justify such conjectures. This explains why the growing countries show higher level of informality.","informal sector, growth, strategic governance, taxation, All these keywords",https://ideas.repec.org/p/ess/wpaper/id12690.html,http://www.esocialsciences.org/Download/repecDownload.aspx?fname=A201845161721_57.pdf&fcategory=Articles&AId=12690&fref=repec,RePEc:ess:wpaper:id:12690,"Dibyendu Maiti & Chandril Bhattacharyya, 2018.

,Effects of Contract Governance on Public Private Partnership (PPP) Performance,Chandan Kumar,"This paper empirically examines the impact of differences in contract attributes on project outcomes. The hypothesis is to test whether better incentive structure and stricter administrative controls lead to more efficient project outcomes. It compares two sets of contracts (called as toll and annuity) from Indian PPP road projects which are designed for the same task and implemented under the similar conditions, but have some differences in the contract governance attributes. It carries out this exercise using data from more than 150 projects. The empirical findings highlight how instruments of governance influence the degree of efficiency in achieving the desired results. For instance, the annuity model, that has tighter budget constraint (i.e. better incentive structure) than the toll model, performs better in terms of minimizing cost and time overruns.","Contracts, Transaction Cost Economics, Road sector, Public Private Partnership, India, Public Private Partnership (PPP), Road Sector, Bidding Method, Contract Design, Monte Carlo Simulation, Sensitivity Analysis, Opportunism, Hold-up, Contracts, Public Private Partnership, design, low probability, possible opportunism, accountability, Indian PPP contracts, India, All these keywords",https://ideas.repec.org/p/ess/wpaper/id12689.html,http://www.esocialsciences.org/Download/repecDownload.aspx?fname=A201845153241_29.pdf&fcategory=Articles&AId=12689&fref=repec,RePEc:ess:wpaper:id:12689,"Chandan Kumar, 2018.

,Role of Bidding Method and Risk Allocation in the Performance of Public Private Partnership (PPP) Projects,Chandan Kumar,"This paper analyses the Indian PPP framework, including its bidding process and the standard concession agreement. The paper argues that the existing bidding method (i.e. premium/grant based method) can result in overvaluation of the projects due to optimism bias. When optimism about high traffic volumes do not materialize in the long run, projects could come under stress or fail, which is quite visible for Indian PPP road projects. This paper discusses an alternative bidding method called least present value of revenue (LPVR) and compares this method for the Indian PPP set-up with the help of Monte Carlo simulations by creating various real-life kind of scenarios. Results show that both methods have their own advantages depending on what was expected and what is actually realized. If expectations are low, then both methods gives more or less competitive results, but as expectations increase the LPVR method starts giving better results with a reasonably high certainty.","Public Private Partnership (PPP), Road Sector, Bidding Method, Contract Design, Monte Carlo Simulation, Sensitivity Analysis, Opportunism, Hold-up, Contracts, Public Private Partnership, design, low probability, possible opportunism, accountability, Indian PPP contracts, India, All these keywords",https://ideas.repec.org/p/ess/wpaper/id12688.html,http://www.esocialsciences.org/Download/repecDownload.aspx?fname=A201845152953_29.pdf&fcategory=Articles&AId=12688&fref=repec,RePEc:ess:wpaper:id:12688,"Chandan Kumar, 2018.

It examines the contract design of the Indian PPP road contracts and analyzes its strengths and weaknesses to avoid the opportunism or hold-up using the probabilistic framework. This framework suggests that each type of contract should have its own self-enforcing range to make it incentive compatible. This paper compares the risk allocated in the two types of contracts (i.e. linked and delinked contracts) for delivering the project on time. Further, it empirically tests these findings using 82 PPP projects.","Opportunism, Hold-up, Contracts, Public Private Partnership, design, low probability, possible opportunism, accountability, Indian PPP contracts, India, All these keywords",https://ideas.repec.org/p/ess/wpaper/id12687.html,http://www.esocialsciences.org/Download/repecDownload.aspx?fname=A201845152410_29.pdf&fcategory=Articles&AId=12687&fref=repec,RePEc:ess:wpaper:id:12687,"Chandan Kumar, 2018.

,ICT investment and economic growth in India: An industry perspective,"K L Krishna, Abdul Azeez Erumban, Bishwanath Goldar","The role of information and communication technologies (ICT) in driving economic growth has been well established in the literature. By reducing communication and transaction costs, and improving the quality of capital, ICT helps firms improve their productivity and growth. Given her linguistic and engineering skills, India has been pioneering in ICT exports, in particular export of software services since the 1990s. However, there is hardly any attempt to understand how Indian industries have been taking advantage of the massive growth potential of ICT use in their production process, looking into the experiences of different industries. This has been primarily constrained by lack of adequate, disaggregated data on the ICT use by industries. While there are a few studies trying to understand the contribution of ICT to aggregate economic growth, almost no study has attempted to unearth the role of ICT at detailed industry level. This paper is a first attempt to construct ICT investment series for the registered or organized segment of manufacturing industries in India, and one of the first few attempts that have made so far to build such ICT series for the aggregate Indian economy. The study extends the capital asset database in India KLEMS to include ICT investment, i.e. investment in hardware, software and communication equipment, in respect of different manufacturing industries. The paper also provides preliminary estimates of the contribution of ICT capital to growth in aggregate economy and registered manufacturing sector.",": India, economic growth, information technology, ICT, organized manufacturing, industrywise investment, aggregate economy, All these keywords",https://ideas.repec.org/p/ess/wpaper/id12684.html,http://www.esocialsciences.org/Download/repecDownload.aspx?fname=A201844164612_57.pdf&fcategory=Articles&AId=12684&fref=repec,RePEc:ess:wpaper:id:12684,"K L Krishna & Abdul Azeez Erumban & Bishwanath Goldar, 2018.

,Robot Apocalypse Does It Matter For India'S Manufacturing Industry?,Sunil Mani,"The anxiety that technology will displace jobs on a large scale in the near future is flooding both academic and public debates, primarily in the developed world. The recent publication of a study by Oxford Martin School has predicted that a large number of occupations will see an increased rate of automation. Increased automation is likely to have an adverse effect on employment, especially in the manufacturing sector. India has been trying to increase employment through the manufacturing route. But the capital intensity of its manufacturing sector has been showing a steady increase. Employing a comprehensive dataset from the International Federation of Robotics, the study analyses the nature and extent of diffusion industrial robots in Indian manufacturing industry. Instead of an occupation-based approach, the study uses a task-based one, which presents a more accurate picture of the effect of automation on manufacturing employment. The study shows that the operational stock of industrial robots in manufacturing industry has been showing a systematic increase with the density of robots in the manufacturing sector increasing from less than one per 10000 manufacturing employment to almost 10 in 2016. Most of the robot use is confined to the automotive industry and within it, the application area of welding. This task is supposed to be very human unfriendly and so the diffusion of industrial robots does not appear to be having a deleterious effect on manufacturing employment. However, with significant developments in Artificial Intelligence (AI), robots are becoming more flexible and this may lead to automation of a number of tasks, which were previously thought to be non automatable.","Industrial automation, Robots, Employment, Technological change, India, All these keywords",https://ideas.repec.org/p/ess/wpaper/id12683.html,http://www.esocialsciences.org/Download/repecDownload.aspx?fname=A201844151639_57.pdf&fcategory=Articles&AId=12683&fref=repec,RePEc:ess:wpaper:id:12683,"Sunil Mani, 2018.

,"Cow Vigilantism: Crime, Community and Livelihood January 2016 to March 2018",PUDR Peoples Union for Democratic Rights,"From 2015 there has been a spate of incidents of violence and intimidation around issues of cow slaughter and beef. These ranged from the lynching of Mohammad Akhlaq for alleged cow theft, slaughter and eating beef in Dadri in Uttar Pradesh, to Zahid Ahmed being burnt alive on the Jammu and Kashmir highway on suspicion of transporting cow carcasses in his truck, to the shutting down of the Kerala Bhavan canteen in Delhi, on allegations of serving beef biryani. The draconian framework underlying punishments for alleged slaughter and smuggling necessarily enhances the power and importance of cow vigilantism in the name of protection. Given the political prominence of the issue, the task of documenting vigilantism becomes a necessary exercise for understanding repression in the name of the cow. It is against this political and legal background that the forms of attack against Muslims and Dalits whose livelihoods depend on cattle and beef are to be understood.","Crime, Community, Cow Vigilantism, Livelihood, Democracy, All these keywords",https://ideas.repec.org/p/ess/wpaper/id12682.html,http://www.esocialsciences.org/Download/repecDownload.aspx?fname=A201844133141_57.pdf&fcategory=Articles&AId=12682&fref=repec,RePEc:ess:wpaper:id:12682,"PUDR Peoples Union for Democratic Rights, 2018.

The objective is to find out the changes which have taken place in different labour characteristics over time. It is important as all employed persons are not homogeneous and any change over time in its characteristics has its effect on its marginal product and hence on productivity and growth of GDP. The period covered for the analysis is 1980-81 to 2014-15, which is divided into three-sub-periods, 1980-81 to 1993-94, 1994-95 to 2002-03 and 2003-04 to 2014-15, and the period covered for the organized and unorganized manufacturing industries labour quality indices is 2000-01 to 2014-15. The main results of the analysis are (a) growth of aggregate index of labour quality in India during the period of 1980-2014 grew at an annual average growth rate of 1.4%, which is almost comparable to the growth in persons employed and could contribute significantly to the growth of GDP; (b) the main driver of its growth has been the growth in the education Index which contributed 1.23 percentage points to its growth; (c) growth of aggregate labour quality during 1980-2014 is relatively high in Mining, Electricity, Manufacturing and Services sectors and is low in Agriculture and Construction; and (d) the growth of labour quality is higher in organized manufacturing as compared to unorganized manufacturing.","Employment, Labour, Female, Unorganised sector, All these keywords",https://ideas.repec.org/p/ess/wpaper/id12679.html,http://www.esocialsciences.org/Download/repecDownload.aspx?fname=A20184411543_57.pdf&fcategory=Articles&AId=12679&fref=repec,RePEc:ess:wpaper:id:12679,"K L Krishna & Suresh Chand Aggarwal & Bishwanath Goldar & DEB DAS & E.

,Urbanization and India's Slum Continuum: Evidence on the Range of Policy Needs and Scope of Mobility,Emily Rains,"In contrast with historical precedent, urbanization across the Global South is associated with increasing levels of urban poverty. These trends engender unique challenges for practitioners and scholars of sustainable development. However, data deficits contribute obstacles to formulating effective poverty alleviation policy. Official statistics in developing countries omit the most vulnerable groups, leading to underestimates of the depth, breadth, and permanence of poverty. To address these gaps, we create our own dataset of over 8,000 households across three Indian cities with diverse economic and political histories: Bangalore, Jaipur, and Patna. We leverage satellite data and ground knowledge from local organizations in order to identify slum neighborhoods not contained in official government lists. We provide systematic evidence that living conditions increase along a wide-ranging continuum of wellbeing, corresponding to diverse circumstances and different policy needs. Most of the variation in living conditions is due to differences across rather than within slums. Furthermore, there is evidence of very limited social mobility in slums. These findings suggest a need for policy interventions targeted at the neighborhood level if urbanization is to provide a pathway to upward mobility.","Urbanization, India, Slum, mobility, urban poverty, interventions targeted, practitioners, scholars, family members, evictions, informal settlements, All these keywords",https://ideas.repec.org/p/ess/wpaper/id12633.html,http://www.esocialsciences.org/Download/repecDownload.aspx?fname=A2018321154348_20.pdf&fcategory=Articles&AId=12633&fref=repec,RePEc:ess:wpaper:id:12633,"Emily Rains, 2018.

,Measuring the Equilibrium Impacts of Credit: Evidence from the Indian Microfinance Crisis,"Emily Breza, Cynthia Kinnan","In October 2010, the state government of Andhra Pradesh, India issued an emergency ordinance, bringing microfinance activities in the state to a complete halt and causing a nation-wide shock to the liquidity of lenders, especially those with loans in the affected state. The paper used the massive dislocation in the microfinance market to identify the causal impacts of a reduction in credit supply on consumption, earnings, and employment in general equilibrium. Using a proprietary, hand-collected district-level data set from 25 separate, for-profit microlenders matched with household data from the National Sample Survey, It was found that district-level reductions in credit supply are associated with significant decreases in casual daily wages, household wage earnings and consumption. It was also found that wages in the non-tradable sector fall more than in the tradable sector (agriculture), suggesting that one important impact of the microfinance contraction was transmitted through its effect on aggregate demand. The paper presents a simple two period, two-sector model of the rural economy illustrating this channel and show that our wage results are consistent with a simple calibration of the model.","eSS, state government, emergency ordinance, microfinance activities, liquidity of lenders, loans, massive dislocation, microfinance market, casual impacts, credit supply, consumption, earning, employment, micro-lenders, district-level reductions, casual daily wages, household wage earnings, agriculture, rural economy, wage results., All these keywords",https://ideas.repec.org/p/ess/wpaper/id12587.html,http://www.esocialsciences.org/Download/repecDownload.aspx?fname=A2018310135144_29.pdf&fcategory=Articles&AId=12587&fref=repec,RePEc:ess:wpaper:id:12587,"Emily Breza & Cynthia Kinnan, 2018.

,Managing Financial Globalization: Insights from the Recent Literature,Shang-Jin Wei,"This paper seeks to draw lessons for developing countries based on a survey of the recent literature on financial globalization. First, while capital account openness holds promises (by potentially lowering cost of capital, promoting risk sharing, and providing disciplines on policies), it does not always work out that way in the data. Distortions in the domestic financial market, international capital market, domestic labor market, and domestic public governance can all make financial globalization less beneficial for developing countries. Second, developing countries may seek to avoid the effects of foreign monetary policy shocks. The empirical pattern appears to be somewhere between a trilemma and a dilemma. While nominal exchange rate flexibility provides some policy autonomy but not consistently, capital flow management can confer additional insulation against foreign monetary shocks.","eSS, developing countries, literature, financial globalization, capital account, cost of capital, risk sharing, financial market, international capital market, domestic labour market, public governance, foreign monetary policy shocks, capital flow management, insulation, policies., All these keywords",https://ideas.repec.org/p/ess/wpaper/id12586.html,http://www.esocialsciences.org/Download/repecDownload.aspx?fname=A201831013378_29.pdf&fcategory=Articles&AId=12586&fref=repec,RePEc:ess:wpaper:id:12586,"Shang-Jin Wei, 2018.

,Incentives Can Reduce Bias in Online Reviews,"Ioana Marinescu, Nadav Klein, Andrew Chamberlain, Morgan Smart","Online reviews are a powerful means of propagating the reputations of products, services, and even employers. However, existing research suggests that online reviews often suffer from selection bias""”people with extreme opinions are more motivated to share them than people with moderate opinions, resulting in biased distributions of reviews. Providing incentives for reviewing has the potential to reduce this selection bias, because incentives can mitigate the motivational deficit of people who hold moderate opinions. Using data from one of the leading employer review companies, Glassdoor, the paper shows that voluntary reviews have a different distribution from incentivized reviews. The likely bias in the distribution of voluntary reviews can affect workers' choice of employers, because it changes the ranking of industries by average employee satisfaction.","eSS, online reviews, reputations, products, services, employers, selection bias, opinions, incentives, motivational deficit, moderate opinions, employer review companies, Glassdoor, voluntary reviews, incentivized reviews, workers' choice, ranking of industries, employee satisfaction., All these keywords",https://ideas.repec.org/p/ess/wpaper/id12575.html,http://www.esocialsciences.org/Download/repecDownload.aspx?fname=A201837141352_29.pdf&fcategory=Articles&AId=12575&fref=repec,RePEc:ess:wpaper:id:12575,"Ioana Marinescu & Nadav Klein & Andrew Chamberlain & Morgan Smart, 2018.

It assesses the validity of the measure, and show that it is hard to reconcile with familiar theories of intertemporal choice.

The gap between future and current wellbeing diminishes with age, and in rich countries, is negative among the elderly. The paper also uses the measure to think about income transfers by age and sex. Policies that give priority those with low incomes favor the young and the old, while utilitarian policies favor the middle aged, and men over women.","eSS.

,Sticky Expectations and Consumption Dynamics,"Christopher D. Carroll, Edmund Crawley, Jiri Slacalek, Kiichi Tokuoka, Matthew N. White","Macroeconomic models often invoke consumption ""habits"" to explain the substantial persistence of aggregate consumption growth. But a large literature has found no evidence of habits in microeconomic datasets that measure the behavior of individual households. The paper shows that the apparent conflict can be explained by a model in which consumers have accurate knowledge of their personal circumstances but 'sticky expectations' about the macroeconomy. In the model, the persistence of aggregate consumption growth reflects consumers' imperfect attention to aggregate shocks. The proposed degree of (macro) inattention has negligible utility costs, because aggregate shocks constitute only a tiny proportion of the uncertainty that consumers face.","eSS, sticky expectations, microeconomic datasets, trade, correlation, trade model, spatial correlation, demand system, Ricardian theory, macroeconomic implications, Ricardo's insight, technology, macro counterfactuals, trade partners, self-trade shares, micro estimates, China, Canada, United States, real wages, consumers face., All these keywords",https://ideas.repec.org/p/ess/wpaper/id12563.html,http://www.esocialsciences.org/Download/repecDownload.aspx?fname=A201835121418_29.pdf&fcategory=Articles&AId=12563&fref=repec,RePEc:ess:wpaper:id:12563,"Christopher D.

,Internationalisation of the Rupee,"Shekhar Hari Kumar, Ila Patnaik","This paper evaluates the current status of the Indian Rupee as an international currency using the Chinn and Frankel (2008) framework, and explores the possibility of future Indian Rupee internationalisation. The paper also finds that the Indian Rupee has a negligible role as an official sector currency. It has some use as a reserve currency in its economic sphere of influence, but no role as an anchor or intervention currency. Private actor adoption of the Indian Rupee is much larger and more diverse than the official sector. However, this role is mostly restricted to financial flows and portfolio investment. In terms of trade invoicing and settlements in the private sector, the Indian Rupee plays a limited role due to concerns of convertibility and risk management.","eSS, global financial crisis, Indian Rupee, internalization, currency, official sector currency, economic sphere, diverse, official sector, financial flow, investment, trade, private sector, risk management., All these keywords",https://ideas.repec.org/p/ess/wpaper/id12551.html,http://www.esocialsciences.org/Download/repecDownload.aspx?fname=A2018227143327_29.pdf&fcategory=Articles&AId=12551&fref=repec,RePEc:ess:wpaper:id:12551,"Shekhar Hari Kumar & Ila Patnaik, 2018.

,Social Rewards and the Design of Voluntary Incentive Mechanism for Biodiversity Protection on Farmland,"Rupayan Pal, Ada Wossink, Prasenjit Banerjee","The paper examines how endogenous social preferences could affect economic incentive design to encourage biodiversity protection on private land. A 'green' farmer may enjoy esteem from leading by example if there are few farmers who do the right thing. In contrast a farmer without social preferences ('brown' farmer) might merely tick the boxes and is expected to shirk from the desired environmental actions whenever possible unless this affects their reputation. The paper also analyzes the design of an incentive scheme that takes into account both types of farmers ('green' or 'brown') under asymmetric information about their true motivation. It follows that under perfect Bayesian equilibrium, the regulator can separate out the farmer types in a two-period setting by monitoring their voluntary conservation actions in response to payment in the first period. The optimal mechanism would be a mixture of a facilitation contract with small monetary incentive but high visibility to keep 'green' farmers interested and a higher monetary-incentive contract to attract the brown farmers.","Mechanism Design, Social Norm, Esteem, Motivation Crowding, Signalling, Public goods, Agriculture, endogenous social preferences, economic incentive, biodiversity protection, green farmer, environmental actions, asymmetric information, motivation, Bayesian equilibrium, voluntary conservation, monetary incentive, brown farmers., All these keywords",https://ideas.repec.org/p/ess/wpaper/id12541.html,http://www.esocialsciences.org/Download/repecDownload.aspx?fname=A20182229596_29.pdf&fcategory=Articles&AId=12541&fref=repec,RePEc:ess:wpaper:id:12541,"Rupayan Pal & Ada Wossink & Prasenjit Banerjee, 2018.

,The Growth Slowdown and the Working of Inflation Targeting in India,Ashima Goyal,"The paper presents a variety of indicators to show that demand constrained output during the period of growth slowdown 2011-17. It also draws on research to show the macroeconomic structure of the economy is such that a policy induced demand contraction affects output more than it affects inflation. In this context it evaluates the application and working of inflation targeting. The framework agreed to was flexible inflation targeting but it was too narrowly and strictly implemented initially, although there are signs of moderation in 2018. There was too much emphasis on a weak aggregate demand channel to reduce inflation. Since inflation forecasts were biased upwards the more effective expectations anchoring channel of inflation targeting was under-utilized. Space available due to positive commodity shocks was not made use of so that the negative output gap further widened, even as potential output itself fell. The output sacrifice imposed was therefore higher than necessary. Finally, possible mechanisms to ensure IT is implemented flexibly as required in the Indian context are discussed.","Inflation targeting, monetary policy committee, commodity price shocks, output sacrifice, indicators, growth slowdown, policy, inflation, moderation, channel of inflation, negative output gap, IT, mechanisms, India., All these keywords",https://ideas.repec.org/p/ess/wpaper/id12540.html,http://www.esocialsciences.org/Download/repecDownload.aspx?fname=A20182229492_29.pdf&fcategory=Articles&AId=12540&fref=repec,RePEc:ess:wpaper:id:12540,"Ashima Goyal, 2018.

More than two thirds of the poorest countries in the world are in conflict regions. The nature of armed conflict has changed.

,Agricultural Extension in Cambodia: An Assessment and Options for Reform,"Sam Oeurn Ke, Suresh Chandra Babu","Cambodia's agriculture sector remains the backbone of the country's economy. Most of Cambodia's people live in rural areas and rely heavily on agriculture for their livelihoods. In recent decades, the government has taken several steps to reform the agriculture sector and increase the effectiveness and efficiency of its extension and advisory services. However, farmers and rural producers remain vulnerable to climatic shocks and weather-related disasters, market fluctuations, poor governance, conflict, and disease. Access to reliable, timely, and relevant information is key for building sustainable food systems to support poverty alleviation and hunger reduction. In Cambodia, after the Green Revolution in the 1980s, efforts were made to decrease the gap between small and large farm holders. However, the steps taken did not adequately support smallholder farmers. This paper evaluates the performance of the current extension and advisory system, identifies challenges faced, and analyzes constraints and opportunities for potential reforms. To evaluate Cambodia's current extension and advisory services, we focus on contextual factors such as the policy environment, the capacity of service providers, and production systems. Finally, the paper provides recommendations for both policy makers and practitioners regarding the status of extension and advisory services in Cambodia.

The skewed sex ratio in favor of males led to the identification of ""missing"" women.

Can India Escape it?",Arun Jaitley,"The first order fact about the developing world today is that this is an era of unprecedented prosperity. And that is true about India too which has been one of the most dynamic economic performers in the world. A major driver of these good times, is ""economic convergence,"" whereby poorer countries have grown faster than richer countries and closed the gap in standards of living. The convergence process has been broadening and accelerating for the last 20-30 years. However, while fears of a middle-income trap are overblown, could there be a slowdown in this process for lower-middle-income countries such as India.? The possibility of such a ""Late Converger Stall"" arises because of four possible headwinds in the post-Global Financial Crisis era that were largely absent for the early convergers such as Japan and Korea. These headwinds include: the backlash against globalization which reduces exporting opportunities, the difficulties of transferring resources from low productivity to higher productivity sectors (structural transformation), the challenge of upgrading human capital to the demands of a technology-intensive workplace, and coping with climate change-induced agricultural stress. India has so far defied these headwinds but can continue to do so only if the challenges are decisively addressed.","Economic Development, India, Converger, standards of living, access to essential services, middle-income status, income trap, richer, high-income, GDP per capita, developing world, Goods & Services, world output, All these keywords",https://ideas.repec.org/p/ess/wpaper/id12444.html,http://www.esocialsciences.org/Download/repecDownload.aspx?fname=A2018131125711_20.pdf&fcategory=Articles&AId=12444&fref=repec,RePEc:ess:wpaper:id:12444,"Arun Jaitley, 2018.

India's second and third tiers of government tend to under-perform relative to these standards. The extent of tax and functional devolution to these tiers is one possible explanation. However, one key finding is that these tiers under-collect direct taxes even relative to the powers that they have.

One finding is that investment slowdowns have an impact on growth but not necessarily saving. Another is that recoveries from investment slowdowns, especially those associated with balance sheet difficulties--as in India--tend to be slow. Notably, mean reversion or some degree of automatic bounce-back is absent so that the deeper the slowdown, the slower and shallower the recovery.

,The Politics of Institutional Reform and Post-Conflict Violence in Nepal,Julia Strasheim,"How does the reform of state institutions shape prospects for peace after war? Existing re- search on the institutional causes of peace focuses on how institutional designs, as the out- comes of reform processes, reduce post-conflict violence and promote peace. The literature does not, however, adequately address how the politics that characterise reform processes affect the legitimacy of institutions and whether or not violent protest against these institu- tions ultimately takes place. This focus risks omitting key explanations of how institutional reforms contribute to peace and the mechanisms by which this occurs. By examining the case of Nepal, where clashes between protesters and security forces killed almost 60 people between August 2015 and January 2016, this study shows that emotional rhetoric, elite control of decision-making, backtracking on previous commitments, the acceleration of re- form processes, and the embedding of single reforms in a ""concert"" of reforms that, as a whole, sparks fears of discrimination are all factors that can lead to post-conflict violence.

,Financial Literacy in Japan: Determinants and Impacts,"Naoyuki Yoshino, Peter J. Morgan, Long Q. Trinh","Financial literacy is gaining increasing importance as a policy objective in many countries. However, internationally comparable information on financial literacy is still scarce. Recently, the Bank of Japan conducted a major survey of financial literacy and financial behavior covering 25,000 individuals aged from 18 to 79. This paper used this database to analyze the determinants of financial literacy and the effects of financial literacy on other behaviors. Generally, the study corroborated the findings of studies on other countries, but it uncovered some differences as well. The found that the main determinants of financial literacy are the educational level, income, age, and occupational status and that both financial literacy and general education levels are related positively and significantly to savings behavior and financial inclusion.","financial literacy, financial behavior, financial inclusion, household saving, consumption- and productivity-adjusted dependency ratio, coresidence, household structure, economic growth, household consumption, aging, Japan, All these keywords",https://ideas.repec.org/p/ess/wpaper/id12340.html,http://www.esocialsciences.org/Download/repecDownload.aspx?fname=A20171221153022_29.pdf&fcategory=Articles&AId=12340&fref=repec,RePEc:ess:wpaper:id:12340,"Naoyuki Yoshino & Peter J.

,Evolution of the Infant Health Production Function,"Hope Corman, Dhaval M. Dave, Nancy E. Reichman","This article provides a systematic review of the published literature to date on infant health production and how it has evolved over the past 3-4 decades as data have become more available, computing has improved, and econometric methods have become more sophisticated. While empirical research in most fields has expanded in corresponding ways, the infant health production research has become an important part of the broader and inherently multidisciplinary literature on intergenerational health. The strongest and most robust findings are that policies matter for infant health, particularly those affecting access to health care, and that prenatal smoking and other chemical exposures substantially compromise infant health. Promising directions for future research include elucidating relevant pathways, reconciling the largely inconsistent estimated effects of nutrition and education, and exploring the roles of preconceptional and lifetime health care, paternal factors, social support, housing, complementarity and substitutability of inputs, factors that modify effects of inputs, and evolving medical technologies.","eSS, infant, infant health, infant health production, econometric methods, multidisciplinary literature, intergenerational health, health care, prenatal smoking, chemical exposures, nutrition, education, preconceptional, lifetime health care, paternal factors, social support, housing, complementarity, medical technologies., All these keywords",https://ideas.repec.org/p/ess/wpaper/id12331.html,http://www.esocialsciences.org/Download/repecDownload.aspx?fname=A20171219115752_29.pdf&fcategory=Articles&AId=12331&fref=repec,RePEc:ess:wpaper:id:12331,"Hope Corman & Dhaval M.

It uses the framework to evaluate the cost-effectiveness of various genetic testing strategies. The paper finds that the cost-effectiveness of multiplexed genetic testing (e.g., whole genome sequencing) hinges on the ability of a health system to ensure that dense genotypic information is routinely utilized by physicians. Moreover, while much attention has been paid to lowering the cost of genetic tests, we demonstrate that in practice, other scientific and behavioral factors, focused on certain highyield drug-gene pairs, are key to implementing precision medicine in ways that maximize its value.","Pharmacogenomic Information, simulation model, cost-effectiveness, genetic testing strategies, multiplexed genetic testing, physicians, genotypic information, cost of genetic tests, highyield drug-gene pairs, medicine., All these keywords",https://ideas.repec.org/p/ess/wpaper/id12330.html,http://www.esocialsciences.org/Download/repecDownload.aspx?fname=A20171218153340_29.pdf&fcategory=Articles&AId=12330&fref=repec,RePEc:ess:wpaper:id:12330,"John A.

,Mechanics of Replacing Benefit Systems with a Basic Income: Comparative Results from a Microsimulation Approach,"James Browne, Herwig Immervoll","Recent debates of basic income (BI) proposals shine a useful spotlight on the challenges that traditional forms of income support are increasingly facing, and highlight gaps in social provisions that largely depend on income or employment status. A universal ""no questions asked"" public transfer would be simple and have the advantage that no-one would be left without support. But an unconditional payment to everyone at meaningful but fiscally realistic levels would likely require tax rises as well as reductions in existing benefits. The paper develops a comprehensive BI scenario that facilitates an assessment of the resulting fiscal and distributional effects in a comparative context, undertake a microsimulation study to quantify them, and propose a simple decomposition to identify the mechanisms that drive effects in different country contexts. Results illustrate the challenges, but also the strengths, of existing social protection systems. A BI would fix benefit coverage gaps that exist in many countries, but would require very substantial tax rises if it were to be set at a meaningful level. As support would not be targeted on those most in need, it would not be a cost effective way of directly reducing income poverty.","basic income, targeting, individualisation, conditionality, microsimulation, basic income (BI), traditional forms of income, social provision, employment, public transfer, unconditional payment, fiscal, social protection, cost effective, income, poverty., All these keywords",https://ideas.repec.org/p/ess/wpaper/id12322.html,http://www.esocialsciences.org/Download/repecDownload.aspx?fname=A201712152065_29.pdf&fcategory=Articles&AId=12322&fref=repec,RePEc:ess:wpaper:id:12322,"James Browne & Herwig Immervoll, 2017.

,What does the new 2011-12 IIP series tell us about the Indian manufacturing sector?,"Radhika Pandey, Amey Sapre, Pramod Sinha","The paper discusses the changes in the new 2011-12 base year series of the Index of Industrial Production (IIP) to ask, whether the new series has improved our under-standing of the growth in the manufacturing sector. A simple framework has been developed to separately estimate the contribution of value and volume based commodities in the growth of the manufacturing index. The paper finds that growth in value based commodities contributes significantly in moving the index in both direction and that high growth in value based commodities coincides with periods of low inflation. Findings also show that movements in the IIP Index are increasingly influenced by the trends of WPI as growth in value based commodities may inflate or become subdued, given the fall or rise in the WPI index. As a case study of value based commodities, the paper compares the trends of IIP (Pharmaceuticals) and real Net Sales of firms in the pharmaceuticals sector.

,Can Social Safety Nets Protect Public Health? The Effect of India's Workfare and Foodgrain Subsidy Programmes on Anaemia,"Sudha Narayanan, Nicolas Gerber, Udayan Rathore, Karthikeya Naraparaju","This paper focuses on the consequences of a countrywide guaranteed workfare programme (MGNREGA) and subsidised food distribution scheme (PDS) in India for the prevalence of anaemia, examining whether individuals in districts with a broader reach of these mega-programmes are less likely to be anaemic. Using an Instrumental Variable (IV) approach to address the endogeneity of programme scale, the paper finds that an individual residing in a district where the programmes have broader reach is less likely to suffer from all forms of anaemia and has a lower haemoglobin deficit from the benchmark suggested by the World Health Organisation (WHO) - ranging between 0.91 to 6.2 percentage points for a 10 percentage point expansion in programme scale. While the PDS seems to be more effective in reducing the incidence of mild anaemia than moderate or severe anaemia, while the strength of effects for MGNREGA seem to be the least for mild. These are catch-all effects that represent partial and general equilibrium impacts through multiple pathways. Programme interaction effects suggest the MGNREGA and PDS may be substitutes - associated improvements in anaemia for regions with higher PDS access (MGNREGA participation) are more pronounced when the scale of MGNREGA participation (PDS access) is low. There exist nonlinearities in these relationships, with the efficacy of both programmes varying across scales of implementation.","safety nets, PDS, MGNREGA, India, anaemia, workfare programmes, subsidised food distribution scheme, Instrumental Variable (IV), endogeneity of programme, haemoglobin deficit, World Health Organisation (WHO)., All these keywords",https://ideas.repec.org/p/ess/wpaper/id12296.html,http://www.esocialsciences.org/Download/repecDownload.aspx?fname=A20171211132456_29.pdf&fcategory=Articles&AId=12296&fref=repec,RePEc:ess:wpaper:id:12296,"Sudha Narayanan & Nicolas Gerber & Udayan Rathore & Karthikeya Naraparaju, 2017.

,Response of Firms to Listing: Evidence from SME Exchanges,Susan Thomas,"Public equity markets have increasingly become accessible to small and medium firms with the introduction of dedicated exchange that lower listing criteria to allow such firms to list their equity. The paper exploit the introduction of such a dedicated exchange in India to ask how listing impacts the financial constraints and growth prospects of small and medium firms. The causal impact is assessed using a difference-in-differences estimation based on a sample of firms that listed on these exchanges over a three year period, where we also observe matched firms that are not listed. The paper finds that listing improves the asset size and capital structure of listed firms relative to firms that do not list. But they have not found any evidence that these firms are subsequently able to access higher debt finance from formal institutions, nor evidence of improvement in the performance of these firms, after listing.","Public equity, IPO, reduced listing requirement, small and medium enterprises, transparency, access to finance, firm performance, SME Exchanges, capital structure., All these keywords",https://ideas.repec.org/p/ess/wpaper/id12295.html,http://www.esocialsciences.org/Download/repecDownload.aspx?fname=A2017121113141_29.pdf&fcategory=Articles&AId=12295&fref=repec,RePEc:ess:wpaper:id:12295,"Susan Thomas, 2017.

,Spillovers in Education Choice,"Juanna SchrÃ¸ter Joensen, Helena Skyt Nielsen","This paper examines how skills are shaped by social interactions in families. The paper shows that older siblings causally affect younger sibling's education choices and early career earnings. The paper focuses on critical course choices in high school and overcome the identification challenges of estimating spillover effects in education by exploiting exogenous variation in choice sets stemming from a pilot program. The pilot induced an essentially random subset of older siblings to choose advanced math-science at a lower cost, while not directly affecting the course choices of younger siblings. The paper finds that younger siblings are 2-3 percentage points more likely to choose math-science if their older sibling unexpectedly could choose math-science at a lower cost. The paper argues that the main influence of the pilot program on the younger siblings may be attributed to the social influence of the older sibling. Spillovers are strongest among closely spaced siblings, in particular brothers, and they have a lasting impact on the career out-comes of younger brothers. The paper argues that competition is likely one of the driving forces behind younger siblings conforming to their older siblings' choices.","social interaction, siblings, high school curriculum, skill formation, siblings, older sibling, younger sibling, driving forces, education, education choice, early career earnings, challenges, math-science, pilot program., All these keywords",https://ideas.repec.org/p/ess/wpaper/id12272.html,http://www.esocialsciences.org/Download/repecDownload.aspx?fname=A2017121145852_29.pdf&fcategory=Articles&AId=12272&fref=repec,RePEc:ess:wpaper:id:12272,"Juanna SchrÃ¸ter Joensen & Helena Skyt Nielsen, 2017.

We detect an inverted U- shaped relationship between temperature and TFP and show that it primarily drives the temperature-output effect. Both labor- and capital- intensive firms exhibit sensitivity to high temperatures. By mid 21st century, if no additional adaptation were to occur, it is projected that climate change will reduce Chinese manufacturing output annually by 12%, equivalent to a loss of $39.5 billion in 2007 dollars. This implies substantial local and global economic consequences as the Chinese manufacturing sector produces 32% of national GDP and supplies 12% of global exports.","climate change, productivity, manufacturing, China, Chinese manufacturing plants, effects of temperature, total factor productivity (TFP), factor output, factor input, U- shaped relationship, capital- intensive firms, global economic consequences, Chinese manufacturing sector, GDP, global exports., All these keywords",https://ideas.repec.org/p/ess/wpaper/id12261.html,http://www.esocialsciences.org/Download/repecDownload.aspx?fname=A20171128153524_29.pdf&fcategory=Articles&AId=12261&fref=repec,RePEc:ess:wpaper:id:12261,"Peng Zhang & Olivier Deschenes & Kyle C.

The paper examines a stylized poor state with weak institutions in which a ""culture of evasion"" damages state authority. Many evade tax payments, limiting the state's economic development capability. In the face of extensive corruption, it is challenging for the state to establish and implement policies reflecting good governance; for example, a government that is accountable and transparent, efficient and effective, and follows the rule of law. The rich and poor possess different views on what is the appropriate level of enforcing proper payments of taxes due. The government needs to design an effective tax administration policy that minimizes corruption and is sensitive to the present and future needs of society. To do this it must understand what drives such widespread corruption.","corruption, tax administration, governance, rent-seeking, poor, good governance, endemic corruption, poor state, weak institution, culture of evasion, tax payments, economic development, extensive corruption, accountable, transparent, efficient, effective, rule of law, administration policy., All these keywords",https://ideas.repec.org/p/ess/wpaper/id12242.html,http://www.esocialsciences.org/Download/repecDownload.aspx?fname=A20171121125838_29.pdf&fcategory=Articles&AId=12242&fref=repec,RePEc:ess:wpaper:id:12242,"Gil S.

The electronic Filing (e-Filing) system was introduced to all the Deputy Commissioners' (DC) Offices in 2013. The e-filing system is an electronic file management system where a file in a soft form (or if it is received in hard form, it is transformed to a soft version) is processed and disposed of electronically. The major advantage of the system is that it provides a dashboard which allows the administrator (or whoever as access to) to track every file in the system. Since the head of the office, the DC and the Cabinet Division (the agency comprising of all the ministers and headed by the Prime Minister who also monitors the workings of the whole government including the DC office) has access to the dashboard, the increased monitoring can be expected to improve bureaucratic efficiency and public service delivery.

Finally, it is found that there is an increase in women's self- reported confidence to approach and talk to persons authority (e.g. teachers, doctors).","eSS, adult education, women, knowledge, over- confidence, confidence, teachers, doctors, self -reported, adult literacy, numeracy program, self- awareness., All these keywords",https://ideas.repec.org/p/ess/wpaper/id12196.html,http://www.esocialsciences.org/Download/repecDownload.aspx?fname=A2017113154654_29.pdf&fcategory=Articles&AId=12196&fref=repec,RePEc:ess:wpaper:id:12196,"Ashwini Deshpande & Christopher Ksoll & Annemie Maertens & Vinitha Varghese, 2017.

,Stigma or Red Tape? Roadblocks in the Use of Affirmative Action,Ashwini Deshpande,"This paper examines whether and to what extent, additional stigmatization adversely affects the use of reservations for higher education or jobs. The quantitative analysis is based on a primary survey conducted by the author in the city of Delhi in 2014-15. The empirical analysis focuses on differences in perception of additional stigma of affirmative action between two groups: individuals from the Scheduled Castes (SCs) or Dalits, who belong to castes that are already highly stigmatized, to those from Other Backward Classes (OBCs) who belong to castes and communities that might be low-ranked, but not necessarily stigmatized. The results indicate that a greater proportion of SCs use reservations at least once as compared to OBCs, and a higher score in Class XII (the school leaving examination) increases the probability that individuals will avail of reservations.","eSS, Stigma, red tape, higher education, jobs, perception, Scheduled Castes (SCs), Dalits, castes, Other Backward Classes (OBCs), reservations, higher score, school leaving examination, Affirmative Action, Caste, India, Stigma, Discrimination, All these keywords",https://ideas.repec.org/p/ess/wpaper/id12195.html,http://www.esocialsciences.org/Download/repecDownload.aspx?fname=A2017113152157_29.pdf&fcategory=Articles&AId=12195&fref=repec,RePEc:ess:wpaper:id:12195,"Ashwini Deshpande, 2017.

,Trade Misinvoicing: What can we measure?,"Suranjali Tandon, R. Kavita Rao","The existing studies on trade misinvoicing have focussed on the discrepancy in reported trade statistics between developing and developed countries. The estimates based on such methods rely on the assumption that developed countries report their trade statistics correctly. This paper provides evidence that trade misinvoicing between developed countries is in fact large and any estimate based on such method may not provide an accurate representation of the dimensions of trade misinvoicing in the world. Further, there is need to develop a methodology by which one can attribute the misinvoicing to one or the other trade partner. To address this problem, the paper offers an alternative methodology. Since the exports of a country are necessarily imports of another country which uses domestic factors to predict the export and import misinvoicing for a sample of large misinvoicers for the period 1990 to 2014. Such estimates allow us to establish whether the discrepancy can be attributed to the export or the import side for all countries. The paper finds that the domestic factors better explain the export side, therefore, allowing us to estimate illicit flows through trade misinvocing using the export misinvoicing by all countries.","illicit financial flows, misinvoicing, developing countries, corruption, tariffs, capital controls, illicit flows, trade statistics, trade partners, domestic factors, export, import, Global Financial Integrity (GFI), poor nations., All these keywords",https://ideas.repec.org/p/ess/wpaper/id12152.html,http://www.esocialsciences.org/Download/repecDownload.aspx?fname=A20171010161128_29.pdf&fcategory=Articles&AId=12152&fref=repec,RePEc:ess:wpaper:id:12152,"Suranjali Tandon & R.

The benefits of using DDO-level information are found to be higher while mapping expenditure to healthcare providers in India than mapping to international categories of the SHA 2011.

,The Macroeconomic Benefits of Tax Enforcement in Pakistan,"Ethan Ilzetzki, David Lagakos","The benefits of improved tax enforcement in Pakistan through simulations of a model of the Pakistani economy is studied. We begin by documenting that the effective tax rate facing firms is increasing in firm size, with firms in the modern sector facing tax rates nearly ten percentage points higher than in the traditional sector. In addition, larger firms face substantially higher tax rates than small firms. Effective tax rates range from 5% for smaller firms to 10% for middle-sized firms and 15% for the largest firms. We then build a two-sector (modern and traditional) model of the Pakistani economy. Simulations of the model show that improvements in tax enforcement could increase revenues (by 8% in our middle scenario) but also reduce informality (by 3.3 percentage points) and increase GDP (by nearly 2%). We contrast this with a one percentage point increase in the tax rate, which increases tax revenues, but reduces GDP and increases the rate of informality","Pakistan, Tax enforcement, Macroeconomics, growth rates, infrastructure, expenditure, social programs, revenues, manufacturing, formal sector, agriculture, trade, productivity, traditional sector, All these keywords",https://ideas.repec.org/p/ess/wpaper/id12130.html,http://www.esocialsciences.org/Download/repecDownload.aspx?fname=A2017104131410_20.pdf&fcategory=Articles&AId=12130&fref=repec,RePEc:ess:wpaper:id:12130,"Ethan Ilzetzki & David Lagakos, 2017.

,Bolder Disinvestment or Better Performance Contracts? Which Way Forward for India's State-Owned Enterprises,"Ajay Chhibber, Swati Gupta","This paper analyses the performance of India's Public Sector Undertakings (PSUs) using measures of labour and overall efficiency and productivity indicators as opposed to financial returns. Using methods that correct for selection bias, the results show that performance contracts do not improve firm efficiency but disinvestment has a very strong positive effect on firm efficiency. Disinvestment improves labour productivity and efficiency, which is not surprising, but it also improves overall efficiency. India should pursue much bolder privatization even of PSUs which claim to be making operational profits - such as Air India, because privatization improves overall firm efficiency and unlocks capital for use elsewhere, especially in public infrastructure, and reduces the possibility of political interference in their functioning in future.","Public Sector Undertakings, State Owned Enterprises, Public Sector Restructuring, MOU (performance contract), Disinvestment ( privatization), public infrastructure, political interference, capital, bolder privatization, labour productivity, India., All these keywords",https://ideas.repec.org/p/ess/wpaper/id12127.html,http://www.esocialsciences.org/Download/repecDownload.aspx?fname=A2017103133914_29.pdf&fcategory=Articles&AId=12127&fref=repec,RePEc:ess:wpaper:id:12127,"Ajay Chhibber & Swati Gupta, 2017.

,On the Importance of Triangulating Datasets to Examine Indians on the Move,"S. Chandrasekhar, Mukta Naik, Shamindra Nath Roy","A chapter dedicated to migration in the Economic Survey 2016-17 signals the willingness on the part of Indian policymakers to address the linkages between migration, labour markets and economic development. This paper attempts to take forward this discussion.
