,"Technology, Globalisation and Multinationals The Asian Experience (Second Edition)",N S Siddharthan,"This second edition of the volume of Technology, Globalisation and Multinationals deals with issues relating to foreign direct investments (FDI); technology spillovers from FDI; in-house research and development (R&D) activities by enterprises; FDI in R&D global technology spillovers; technology and trade, information technology (IT) and outsourcing; universities, academic institutions and industry relationships. This volume differs from the earlier studies in one important respect. The earlier studies presented an exhaustive and comprehensive survey of literature on these issues, while this volume concentrates on select studies published in mainstream journals and discuss in-depth the data, methodology and findings of these select studies. An indepth analysis of some of the important studies in these areas and drawing appropriate conclusions and implications would be useful to students and scholars interested in this area. The volume will concentrate mainly on Asian studies. However, benchmark studies dealing with Europe and the US will be included.","FDI, technology, multinationals, R and D, India, Asia, All these keywords",https://ideas.repec.org/p/ess/wpaper/id13158.html,http://www.esocialsciences.org/Download/repecDownload.aspx?fname=A20219160396_19.pdf&fcategory=Articles&AId=13158&fref=repec,RePEc:ess:wpaper:id:13158,"N S Siddharthan, 2021.

,Is India Creating Adequate Jobs Post 2000: Treading Through Employment Elasticity,"G.D Bino Paul, Muralidharan T","This paper looks into diverse databases to gauge if economic growth in India creates adequate volume of jobs since the year 2000. In our exercise, we use a popular index called employment elasticity. This indicator says to what extent the employment expands while the economy grows. First, gauging the employment elasticity, we provide a comparative picture of India and other BRICS countries during 2000-2017. Second, using the time series data for 2000 to 2016, we present the analysis pertinent to India, disaggregated for Industries. Finally, we examine the temporal change in employment elasticity with respect to the organised manufacturing in India during 2000-2014. In essence, the data conveys that India needs to create discernibly higher volume of jobs in response to the impending economic growth or find other avenues like Manpower exports or entrepreneurship growth. All three exercises concur with the conclusion that job creation in India needs a gearing up since proportionate expansion in employment is not even a fifth of expansion in value added in the economy. What makes this attempt distinct from the extant literature is that it uses more granular data with respect to the household and the enterprise, while it examines the indicator from the macro angle, as well.","employment, employment elasticity, jobs, manpower exports, entrepreneurship growth, household data, job creation, india, south Asia, All these keywords",https://ideas.repec.org/p/ess/wpaper/id13093.html,http://www.esocialsciences.org/Download/repecDownload.aspx?fname=A202062605047_19.pdf&fcategory=Articles&AId=13093&fref=repec,RePEc:ess:wpaper:id:13093,"G.D Bino Paul & Muralidharan T, 2020.

,Inequality in a Global Perspective,Ravi Kanbur,"The basic story of global inequality in the last three decades has been an overall decline, but one which is composed of quite intricate patterns. There has been a decline in between country inequality as China and India have grown relative to the US and other rich countries. This has been accompanied by an increase in within country inequality, but this is itself composed of rising inequality in some countries such as China, India and the US, and declining inequality in other countries, including large economies in Latin America. Section 2 of the paper will review these patterns, highlighting country diversity to make the central point that policy matters. Section 3 addresses a normative question""‚Äùwhat relative weight should be given to within country and between inequality in making an overall global assessment? This section will bring on board recent philosophical discourse, including on inequality of opportunity in a global frame. Section 4 will return to the ""policy matters"" theme and take up global constraints on national redistribution policy in a globalized world, for example a race to the bottom on taxation to attract and keep capital and talent, and possible global institutional responses to alleviate these constraints.

,Emerging Markets Perspectives on G-20 led Financial Reforms,"Ashima Goyal, Akhilesh Verma","The chapter examines progress as well as continuing concerns in G-20 led financial reforms, with particular emphasis on emerging markets (EMs). Although risks remain they are of a lower order of magnitude compared to those in the pre global crisis period. But progress is slowest in areas of concern to EMs. Question marks over liquidity in markets as quantitative easing is withdrawn are echoed in EMs, which also face risk-off outflows and volatile exchange rates in this period. Leverage is high in some EMs after a period of low global interest rates and risk-on inflows in search of yields. But EMs are largely left to handle volatility themselves. Even the advice given to them or its understanding in policy circles or markets is not sufficiently nuanced. There are arguments for and against financial tightening as the best response to achieve financial stability. These are examined in the context of experiences in some specific EMs. Implications are drawn for G-20 policies and for its advice to EMs.","eSS, G-20, Financial reforms, Emerging markets, emerging markets (EMs), volatile exchange rates, pre global crisis period., All these keywords",https://ideas.repec.org/p/ess/wpaper/id13042.html,http://www.esocialsciences.org/Download/repecDownload.aspx?fname=A2019425114636_29.pdf&fcategory=Articles&AId=13042&fref=repec,RePEc:ess:wpaper:id:13042,"Ashima Goyal & Akhilesh Verma, 2019.

,"News, Noise and Indian Business Cycle","Ashima Goyal, Abhishek Kumar","New Keynesian Dynamic Stochastic General Equilibrium (DSGE) models with various specifications of technology, markup and interest rate shocks are estimated with Indian data using Kalman filter based pure and Bayesian likelihood estimation. Preference and interest rate shocks are found to be important for output determination whereas markup and interest rate shocks are important for inflation. News, such as contained in stock market variables and arising from anticipated interest rates, affects growth of gross domestic product. Interest rate shock is anticipated at horizon of one quarter and out of total variance explained by interest rate shock, one third is due to the anticipated shock. Anticipated interest rate shock diminishes the role of preference shock in output determination. Markup shock has a large share, very low persistence but is correlated. There is evidence that permanent component of technology is not well anticipated, and once we incorporate that technology shocks become more important for determination of output although it still remains much below US levels.

,Macroprudential Policy in Asian Economies,Soyoung Kim,"This paper analyzes the conduct and effects of macroprudential policy in 11 Asian economies. Of these, India, the People's Republic of China, and the Republic of Korea frequently used loan-to-value ratios and required reserve ratios even before the global financial crisis. India and the People's Republic of China are the most frequent users of macroprudential policy tools. Since 2000, tightening actions have been more frequent than loosening in the 11 economies. Most took tightening actions more frequently after the global financial crisis than before it. In most of these economies, macroprudential policy tends to be tightened when credit expands. The main empirical results from the analysis, which uses panel vector autoregression models, are that contractionary macroprudential policy has significant negative effects on credit and output; and that these effects are qualitatively similar to those of monetary policy. This suggests that policy authorities may experience potential policy conflicts when credit conditions are excessive and the economy is in recession.","eSS, Macroprudential Policy, Asian Economies, People's Republic of China, macroprudential policy tools, global financial crisis., All these keywords",https://ideas.repec.org/p/ess/wpaper/id13036.html,http://www.esocialsciences.org/Download/repecDownload.aspx?fname=A2019423123735_29.pdf&fcategory=Articles&AId=13036&fref=repec,RePEc:ess:wpaper:id:13036,"Soyoung Kim, 2019.

,Impact of Changes in Fiscal Federalism and Fourteenth Finance Commission Recommendations Scenarios on States Autonomy and Social Sector Priorities,"Amarnath H. K., Alka Singh","This paper compares the additional gains from higher tax devolution in the post 14th FC period, with the additional burden due to the withdrawal of certain central schemes and the changes in the sharing pattern of major Centrally Sponsored Schemes calling for greater contribution from the states. Average burden of the general category states due to CSS is 0.69 percent of combined GSDP of these states, whereas gains in tax devolution is 0.71 percent of combined GSDP of these states for the year 2015-16. In the following year, the difference is even less. This paper questions the rhetoric of greater autonomy for the states, which claims that the states have got additional money in the form of tax devolution and are therefore free to decide the priorities.

,"Price Discovery in Indian Government Securities Market, Monetary Management and the Cost of Government Borrowing",Ashima Goyal,"Over 2017-18 there was a sharp rise in Indian government securities (G-Secs) interest rates unrelated to fundamentals. Examining each of the standard explanatory variables shows them to be inadequate to account for the rise in bond yields in this period. Turning to aspects of Indian structure the reason is found to be the narrow focus of monetary operating procedures, with excessive reliance on making up liquidity shortfalls with short-term liquidity, which was inadequate given large exogenous durable liquidity shocks including foreign inflows. The composition of liquidity, share of reserve money and its sources all matter. Open market operations (OMOs) have a significant impact on yields. Large foreign debt inflows induce OMOs sales as G-Secs are swapped for foreign securities to sterilize the effect of inflows on the money supply. G-Secs yields are then found to rise.","Ess, Government securities market, yields, open market operations, debt inflows, price discovery, Monetary Management, Cost of Government Borrowing, Open market operations (OMOs)., All these keywords",https://ideas.repec.org/p/ess/wpaper/id13027.html,http://www.esocialsciences.org/Download/repecDownload.aspx?fname=A2019329141342_29.pdf&fcategory=Articles&AId=13027&fref=repec,RePEc:ess:wpaper:id:13027,"Ashima Goyal, 2019.

,What Explains the Volatility of India's Catch-up Growth?,Ashima Goyal,"Indian post reform growth rates have been higher but more volatile compared to transition periods for other comparable countries. The reasons are aggravation of shocks due to unaddressed critical bottlenecks together with pro-cyclical macroeconomic policy that compressed aggregate demand. Reform is required to relieve constraints, but traditional reforms may be neither appropriate nor achievable. Feasible reforms are discussed.

,India's Universal Basic Income: Bedeviled by the Details,Saksham Khosla,"The idea of a Universal Basic Income (UBI)-""‚Äùperiodic and uncon- ditional cash payments to all citizens""‚Äùhas gained renewed attention amid growing concerns about technological unemployment in advanced economies. More recently, economists have made the case for a UBI in the developing world, where cash transfers distributed to all citizens, rich and poor, may cut through layers of red tape and lead to outsize gains in poverty reduction. In India, a rapid expansion of direct cash transfers linked to the national biometric database and small basic income experiments have galvanized an extensive debate on a UBI. Supporters claim that no-strings-attached payments will be an effective antidote to India's underperforming antipoverty programs and leaky, distortionary subsidies. Critics worry that they will undermine an already-fragile social security architecture, cause workers to drop out of the labor force, and encourage wasteful spending.Rather than relying exclusively upon the survey's proposed methods for financing, targeting, and distributing a UBI, Indian policymakers should join their Finnish and Canadian counterparts in running one or several large-scale experimental evaluations. By determining the impact on both the government (state and fiscal capacity) and citizens (economic and social outcomes), such trials can generate new empirical evidence to inform the growing UBI debate and reveal the most effective role for unconditional transfers in India's welfare architecture.","UBI, Universal Basic Income, unconditional transfers, welfare architecture, anti-poverty programmes, social security architecture, All these keywords",https://ideas.repec.org/p/ess/wpaper/id13024.html,http://www.esocialsciences.org/Articles/show_Article.aspx?acat=InstitutionalPapers&aid=13024,RePEc:ess:wpaper:id:13024,"Saksham Khosla, 2019.

This finding challenges the traditional view that countries in their economic development need to have their workforce employed first in manufacturing before switching to services. Lastly, the paper studies how different skill levels contribute to labor productivity growth.

,Outward FDI and Crossborder M&As by Indian Firms: A Host Country-Level Analysis,P.L. Beena,"This paper tries to understand the trends and the pattern of Outward Foreign Direct Investment (OFDI) by Indian firms and the factors that determine OFDI from India through Cross-Border Mergers and Acquisitions (CBM&As). As economic activities of those firms in the respective host countries are not accessible, the present study is restricted to analyse the push and pull factors, based on the macroeconomic indicators of the leading nineteen countries that hosted such investments between 2004 and 2015. The study employs Negative binomial and Ordinary Least Square (OLS) panel data regression. It is based on a theoretical framework, i) by drawing insights mainly from the Ownership Location Internationalisation (OLI) theory on determinants of FDI, namely, market-seeking, resource seeking and strategic asset seeking, and ii)by controlling other variables such as India's Real Effective Exchange Rate and Institutional factors.","eSS, Outward Foreign Direct Investment (OFDI), Cross-Border Mergers and Acquisitions (CBM&As), economic activities, Indian firms, macroeconomic indicators, investments, Negative binomial, Ordinary Least Square (OLS), theoretical framework, Ownership Location Internationalisation (OLI), exchange rate, India., All these keywords",https://ideas.repec.org/p/ess/wpaper/id12993.html,http://www.esocialsciences.org/Download/repecDownload.aspx?fname=A2019131122611_29.pdf&fcategory=Articles&AId=12993&fref=repec,RePEc:ess:wpaper:id:12993,"P.L.

,Enlargement Decisions of Regional Trading Blocs with Asymmetric Members,Sunandan Ghosh,"This paper analyzes the conditions under which an existing bilateral free trade area (FTA) prefers to expand in size and when it prefers consolidation through customs union (CU) formation when the existing members of the FTA are asymmetric, both with respect to production technology and domestic market sizes. The analytical framework employs a standard oligopolistic strategic trade model in a three-country world. In presence of technology asymmetry, there will exist a clash of interest between the FTA members while the non-member will always prefer to join the bloc. Global free trade can be sustained as a subgame perfect Nash equilibrium only for lower degrees of production inefficiency while for higher degrees of production inefficiency a CU between the initial members can be sustained in the presence of some side payments.","eSS, Consolidation, Expansion, Regional Trading Blocs, free trade area (FTA), customs union (CU), oligopolistic strategic trade model, Global free trade, production inefficiency, payments., All these keywords",https://ideas.repec.org/p/ess/wpaper/id12992.html,http://www.esocialsciences.org/Download/repecDownload.aspx?fname=A2019131122027_29.pdf&fcategory=Articles&AId=12992&fref=repec,RePEc:ess:wpaper:id:12992,"Sunandan Ghosh, 2019.

,"Multi- Product Firms, Tariff Liberalization and Product Churning in Vietnamese Manufacturing",Ha Thi Thanh Doan,"This study documents the frequency and characteristics of multi-product firms in Vietnamese manufacturing. The major findings are as follows. First, multi-product firms are larger, more capital-intensive, more productive, and are more likely to export. Second, multi-product firms are active in the market. Approximately 60% of firms adjust their product scope within a 6-year period. Third, the contribution of firms' product extensive margin to aggregate output growth is limited due to the prevalence of product dropping, which offsets the positive impact of product adding. Most output growth during the period is thus generated by the intensive margin. Turning to the link between tariff reduction and product shedding, it does not detect any significant impact. However, it finds that exporters play an important role in product adding, which suggests that they may contribute to aggregate growth through the channeling of product scope expansion. Contrary to the expectations, the analysis offers limited support for the heterogeneity of product turnover across ownership types. While it finds that state-owned enterprises are more likely to spread economic activities across products and industries, there is little difference in terms of product churning amongst foreign direct investment, state-owned enterprises, and the domestic private sector.","eSS, multi-product firms, trade liberalization, tariff liberalization, manufacturing, capital- intensive, export, ownership, enterprises, economic activities, industries, foreign direct investment, state-owned enterprises, domestic private sector., All these keywords",https://ideas.repec.org/p/ess/wpaper/id12984.html,http://www.esocialsciences.org/Download/repecDownload.aspx?fname=A201912912517_29.pdf&fcategory=Articles&AId=12984&fref=repec,RePEc:ess:wpaper:id:12984,"Ha Thi Thanh Doan, 2019.

,How Does Public Debt Affect the Indian Macroeconomy? A Structural VAR Approach,"Ranjan Kumar Mohanty, Sidheswar Panda","This study investigates the macroeconomic effects of public debt in India using a Structural Vector Auto regression (SVAR) framework for the period from 1980 to 2017. The objective of this study is to examine the impact of several types of public debt on economic growth, investment, interest rate and inflation in India. The results of the Impulse response functions show that public debt has an adverse impact on economic growth, a positive impact on long-term interest rate and a mixed response (both negative and positive) on investment and inflation in India. It is also found that the domestic debt has a more adverse impact on the economy than external debt in India. The estimated variance decomposition analysis shows that much of the variations among selected macro variables are explained by public debt and growth in India. The study suggests that public debt, especially the domestic debt should be controlled and used in a more productive manner in order to have a favourable impact on the economy.","eSS, Public Debt, Internal Debt, External Debt, Economic Growth, Structural VAR Approach, Structural Vector Auto regression (SVAR), economic growth, interest rate, inflation, India, All these keywords",https://ideas.repec.org/p/ess/wpaper/id12980.html,http://www.esocialsciences.org/Download/repecDownload.aspx?fname=A201912315745_29.pdf&fcategory=Articles&AId=12980&fref=repec,RePEc:ess:wpaper:id:12980,"Ranjan Kumar Mohanty & Sidheswar Panda, 2019.

,Examining the Trade-Off Between Price and Financial Stability in India,"Ila Patnaik, Shalini Mittal, Radhika Pandey","In recent years, many emerging economies including India have adopted inflation targeting framework. Post the global financial crisis, there is a growing debate on whether monetary policy should target financial stability. Using India as a case study, it presents an empirical approach to assess whether monetary policy can target financial stability. This is done by examining the trade-off between price and financial stability for India. Using correlation between price and financial cycles, it finds that a trade-off exists between price and financial stability. The findings is robust to a series of robustness checks. The study has implications for the conduct of monetary policy in emerging economies. Presence of a trade-off may constrain the ability of a central bank in emerging economies to target financial stability with monetary policy instrument.","eSS, inflation targeting framework, global financial crisis, monetary policy, financial stability, empirical approach, trade-off, price, financial cycles, robustness checks, central bank, monetary policy instrument, India., All these keywords",https://ideas.repec.org/p/ess/wpaper/id12979.html,http://www.esocialsciences.org/Download/repecDownload.aspx?fname=A20191231521_29.pdf&fcategory=Articles&AId=12979&fref=repec,RePEc:ess:wpaper:id:12979,"Ila Patnaik & Shalini Mittal & Radhika Pandey, 2019.

,What do we Know about Changing Economic Activity of Firms?,"Radhika Pandey, Amey Sapre, Pramod Sinha","Identification of primary economic activity of √Ç¬¨firms is a prerequisite for compiling several macro aggregates. This paper takes a statistical approach to understand the extent of changes in primary economic activity of √Ç¬¨firms over time and across different industries. It uses the history of economic activity of over 46000 √Ç¬¨firms spread over 25 years from CMIE Prowess to identify the number of times √Ç¬¨firms change the nature of their business. Using the count of changes, it estimates Poisson and Negative Binomial regression models to gain predictability over changing economic activity across industry groups. The paper shows that a Poisson model accurately characterizes the distribution of count of changes across industries and that √Ç¬¨firms with a long history are more likely to have changed their primary economic activity over the years. Findings show that classification can be a crucial problem in a large dataset like the MCA21 and can even lead to distortions in value addition estimates at the industry level.","eSS, : Economic Activity, Manufacturing, India, Poisson Distribution, statistical approach, Poisson and Negative Binomial regression models, Poisson model, value addition, industry., All these keywords",https://ideas.repec.org/p/ess/wpaper/id12978.html,http://www.esocialsciences.org/Download/repecDownload.aspx?fname=A2019123145343_29.pdf&fcategory=Articles&AId=12978&fref=repec,RePEc:ess:wpaper:id:12978,"Radhika Pandey & Amey Sapre & Pramod Sinha, 2019.

,Responses to Trade Opening: Evidence and Lessons from Asia,Devashish Mitra,"In various Asian countries, international trade has raised productivity, lowered mark ups through import competition (while increasing them through cheaper inputs that can be imported), raised wages, expanded employment, and, above all, reduced poverty. This is in sharp contrast to the impact of trade in some of the Latin American countries, which suggests exercising caution in extrapolating results to Asian countries that have not yet been studied. There are also a few adverse consequences of trade that already been found for Asia. Apart from raising inequality, trade can increase informality, especially in the presence of labor-market rigidities. Additionally, there are the adverse effects stemming from trade adjustment as a result of worker mobility costs. In this context, this study discusses various policies that researchers have recommended.","eSS, trade, trade opening, international trade, productivity, import competition, employment, poverty, labor-market rigidities, worker mobility, costs, policies, Asian Countries, Asia., All these keywords",https://ideas.repec.org/p/ess/wpaper/id12977.html,http://www.esocialsciences.org/Download/repecDownload.aspx?fname=A201912214113_29.pdf&fcategory=Articles&AId=12977&fref=repec,RePEc:ess:wpaper:id:12977,"Devashish Mitra, 2019.

,Exporting and Firm Performance: Evidence from India,"Apoorva Gupta, Ila Patnaik, Ajay Shah","In this paper the positive correlation between firm productivity and export status is well established. This correlation can arise from multiple alternative casual models. It has investigated these relationships, harnessing the transition of several firms from serving the domestic market to exporting, in a dataset of Indian firms from 1989 to 2015. Each firm which made the transition is matched against a control which did not. The transitions take place across many years, thus permitting a matched event study in firm outcomes. The paper finds there is self-selection of more productive firms into exporting. Firms that make the transition become bigger, but there is little evidence of learning by exporting, of improvements in productivity right after exporting commences. However, there is evidence of improvement in productivity of export starters a couple of years before they begin to export.","eSS, export, firms, firm productivity, export status, casual models, domestic markets, dataset, productive firms, domestic market, transition, India., All these keywords",https://ideas.repec.org/p/ess/wpaper/id12969.html,http://www.esocialsciences.org/Download/repecDownload.aspx?fname=A2019112121938_29.pdf&fcategory=Articles&AId=12969&fref=repec,RePEc:ess:wpaper:id:12969,"Apoorva Gupta & Ila Patnaik & Ajay Shah, 2019.

,"Analyzing the Dynamic Relationship between Physical Infrastructure, Financial Development and Economic Growth in India","Ranjan Kumar Mohanty, N. R. Bhanumurthy","The paper investigates dynamic relationship between physical infrastructure, financial development and economic growth in the case of India, using an Autoregressive Distributed Lag (ARDL) and Toda-Yamamoto (T-Y) causality approach for the period 1980 to 2016. Physical infrastructure index and financial development index are constructed using Principal Component Analysis method. Empirical results suggest that physical infrastructure has a positive effect on economic growth both in the long-run and short-run, whereas financial development, though significant, has a weak impact on economic growth. The causality test supports a bi-directional causal relationship between infrastructure development and economic growth, while it finds a unidirectional causation running from economic growth to financial development. It also finds that gross investment and employment have a positive, and inflation has an adverse effect on economic growth. As India is aiming for higher growth for a sustained period, our results suggest that there is a need for Government intervention in expanding the physical infrastructure and this, in turn, could lead to the growth of the financial sector in the country.","eSS, financial sector, Infrastructure Index, Financial Development Index, Economic Growth, ARDL Approach, India, All these keywords",https://ideas.repec.org/p/ess/wpaper/id12967.html,http://www.esocialsciences.org/Download/repecDownload.aspx?fname=A201911112492_29.pdf&fcategory=Articles&AId=12967&fref=repec,RePEc:ess:wpaper:id:12967,"Ranjan Kumar Mohanty & N.
