It is proven that large enterprises create very few jobs. Even these few jobs are created for educated youth. Only Micro and Small Enterprises (MSEs) can create large number of jobs across India for workers with wide range of skills and education.we need to scale-up these existing MSEs. We can do this by creating a support system which will make these MSEs go digital, grow in scale and increase their productivity. This will automatically create jobs The Udyog Sahayak Enterprise Network (USENET) proposed in this report is that support system.","employment, youth, MSME, micro and small enterprises, USENET, employment generation, India, South Asia, All these keywords",https://ideas.repec.org/p/ess/wpaper/id13136.html,http://www.esocialsciences.org/Download/repecDownload.aspx?fname=A202122155027_19.pdf&fcategory=Articles&AId=13136&fref=repec,RePEc:ess:wpaper:id:13136,"T Muralidharan & G.D Bino Paul & Amit Basole, 2021.

,Is India Creating Adequate Jobs Post 2000: Treading Through Employment Elasticity,"G.D Bino Paul, Muralidharan T","This paper looks into diverse databases to gauge if economic growth in India creates adequate volume of jobs since the year 2000. In our exercise, we use a popular index called employment elasticity. This indicator says to what extent the employment expands while the economy grows. First, gauging the employment elasticity, we provide a comparative picture of India and other BRICS countries during 2000-2017. Second, using the time series data for 2000 to 2016, we present the analysis pertinent to India, disaggregated for Industries. Finally, we examine the temporal change in employment elasticity with respect to the organised manufacturing in India during 2000-2014. In essence, the data conveys that India needs to create discernibly higher volume of jobs in response to the impending economic growth or find other avenues like Manpower exports or entrepreneurship growth. All three exercises concur with the conclusion that job creation in India needs a gearing up since proportionate expansion in employment is not even a fifth of expansion in value added in the economy. What makes this attempt distinct from the extant literature is that it uses more granular data with respect to the household and the enterprise, while it examines the indicator from the macro angle, as well.","employment, employment elasticity, jobs, manpower exports, entrepreneurship growth, household data, job creation, india, south Asia, All these keywords",https://ideas.repec.org/p/ess/wpaper/id13093.html,http://www.esocialsciences.org/Download/repecDownload.aspx?fname=A202062605047_19.pdf&fcategory=Articles&AId=13093&fref=repec,RePEc:ess:wpaper:id:13093,"G.D Bino Paul & Muralidharan T, 2020.

,The Covid-19 Lockdown in India: Gender and Caste Dimensions of the First Job Losses,Ashwini Deshpande,"Based on national-level panel data from Centre for Monitoring Indian Economy (CMIE)'s Consumer Pyramids Household Survey (CPHS) database, this paper investigates the first effects of Covid-19 induced lockdown on employment. Examining the employment status of 37,000 in- dividuals before and after the lockdown, we find that individuals were 12.8 percentage points less likely to be employed post-lockdown. On a pre-lockdown base of 38.9 percent employment, this translates into a 33 precent reduction in the likelihood of being employed. The decline in employment is not gender and caste neutral. Men are more likely to be employed overall, and drop in male employment is greater in absolute terms. However, women who were employed in the pre-lockdown phase were 23.5 percentage points less likely to be employed in the post- lockdown phase, compared to men. Male heads of household were 11.3 percentage points more likely to be employed post-lockdown, compared to female heads of household. Caste differences are not as sharp as gender differences, but the we find that lockdown affected employment of the disadvantaged caste groups relatively more adversely than the higher ranked group of castes.","Covid-19, Lockdown, Employment, Gender, Caste, India, pandemic, COVID, Covid, All these keywords",https://ideas.repec.org/p/ess/wpaper/id13085.html,http://www.esocialsciences.org/Download/repecDownload.aspx?fname=A2020691898_19.pdf&fcategory=Articles&AId=13085&fref=repec,RePEc:ess:wpaper:id:13085,"Ashwini Deshpande, 2020.

,"(In)Visibility, Care and Cultural Barriers: The Size and Shape of Women's Work in India",Ashwini Deshpande,"Based on primary data from a large household survey in seven districts in West Bengal in India, this paper analyses the reasons underlying low labor force participation of women. In particular, we try to disentangle the intertwined strands of choice, constraints posed by domestic work and care responsibilities, and the predominant understanding of cultural norms as factors explaining the low labor force participation as measured by involvement in paid work. We document the fuzziness of the boundary between domestic work and unpaid (and therefore invisible) economic work that leads to mis-measurement of women's work and suggest methods to improve measurement. We find that being primarily responsible for domestic chores lower the probability of ""working"" , after accounting for all the conventional factors. We also document how, for women, being out of paid work is not synonymous with care or domestic work, as they are involved in expenditure saving activities. We also find that religion and visible markers such as veiling are not significant determinants of the probability of working. Our data shows substantial unmet demand for work. Given that women are primarily responsible for domestic chores, we also document that women express a demand for work that would be compatible with household chores.

News, such as contained in stock market variables and arising from anticipated interest rates, affects growth of gross domestic product. Interest rate shock is anticipated at horizon of one quarter and out of total variance explained by interest rate shock, one third is due to the anticipated shock. Anticipated interest rate shock diminishes the role of preference shock in output determination. Markup shock has a large share, very low persistence but is correlated.

,Adverse Selection and Credit Certificates: Evidence from a P2P Platform,"Maggie Rong Hu, Xiaoyang Li, Yang Shi","Certificates are widely used as a signaling mechanism to mitigate adverse selection when information is asymmetric. To reduce information asymmetry between lenders and borrowers, Chinese peer-to-peer (P2P) lending platforms encourage borrowers to obtain various kinds of credit certificates. As P2P markets continue to develop, it is plausible that certification may play a pivotal role in ensuring investment efficiency. It performs the first empirical investigation of this issue, using unique data from Renrendai, one of the People's Republic of China's largest P2P lending platforms. It finds that surprisingly, loans with more credit certificates experience a higher rate of delinquency and default. However, lenders remain attracted by higher certificates despite lower loan performance ex post, which results in distorted capital allocation and reduced investment inefficiency. Overall, the paper documents a setting where credit certificates fail to serve as an accurate signal due to their costless nature, where poor-quality borrowers use more certificates to boost their credit profiles and improve their funding success. Possible explanations for this phenomenon include differences in marginal benefit of certificates for different borrower types, bounded rationality, cognitive simplification, and borrower myopia.","eSS, P2P lending, credit allocation, adverse selection, certificate, bounded rationality, cognitive simplification, All these keywords",https://ideas.repec.org/p/ess/wpaper/id13038.html,http://www.esocialsciences.org/Download/repecDownload.aspx?fname=A201942491619_29.pdf&fcategory=Articles&AId=13038&fref=repec,RePEc:ess:wpaper:id:13038,"Maggie Rong Hu & Xiaoyang Li & Yang Shi, 2019.

,Macroprudential Policy in Asian Economies,Soyoung Kim,"This paper analyzes the conduct and effects of macroprudential policy in 11 Asian economies. Of these, India, the People's Republic of China, and the Republic of Korea frequently used loan-to-value ratios and required reserve ratios even before the global financial crisis. India and the People's Republic of China are the most frequent users of macroprudential policy tools. Since 2000, tightening actions have been more frequent than loosening in the 11 economies. Most took tightening actions more frequently after the global financial crisis than before it. In most of these economies, macroprudential policy tends to be tightened when credit expands. The main empirical results from the analysis, which uses panel vector autoregression models, are that contractionary macroprudential policy has significant negative effects on credit and output; and that these effects are qualitatively similar to those of monetary policy. This suggests that policy authorities may experience potential policy conflicts when credit conditions are excessive and the economy is in recession.","eSS, Macroprudential Policy, Asian Economies, People's Republic of China, macroprudential policy tools, global financial crisis., All these keywords",https://ideas.repec.org/p/ess/wpaper/id13036.html,http://www.esocialsciences.org/Download/repecDownload.aspx?fname=A2019423123735_29.pdf&fcategory=Articles&AId=13036&fref=repec,RePEc:ess:wpaper:id:13036,"Soyoung Kim, 2019.

Implementation of supportive policies for female-owned SMEs will have significant contribution to economic growth, employment, and ultimately, to gender equality. Within a patriarchal society, women are placed in a precarious societal positioning that leads to a prevalence of gender inequality in education, financial literacy, and access to finance. In the context of Asia, where small and medium-sized enterprises (SMEs) are the backbone of most Asian economies and the financial sector is dominated by banks, women in entrepreneurship are susceptible to facing greater credit constraints relative to their male counterparts, which can compromise their corporate performance.

The novel feature of the analysis is the relation of firm-level variations of patent usage to import competition. The results suggest that intensified import competition from the People's Republic of China has resulted in greater innovative activity by Japanese firms, consistent with the findings of European firms in Bloom et al.

,"Price Discovery in Indian Government Securities Market, Monetary Management and the Cost of Government Borrowing",Ashima Goyal,"Over 2017-18 there was a sharp rise in Indian government securities (G-Secs) interest rates unrelated to fundamentals. Examining each of the standard explanatory variables shows them to be inadequate to account for the rise in bond yields in this period. Turning to aspects of Indian structure the reason is found to be the narrow focus of monetary operating procedures, with excessive reliance on making up liquidity shortfalls with short-term liquidity, which was inadequate given large exogenous durable liquidity shocks including foreign inflows. The composition of liquidity, share of reserve money and its sources all matter. Open market operations (OMOs) have a significant impact on yields. Large foreign debt inflows induce OMOs sales as G-Secs are swapped for foreign securities to sterilize the effect of inflows on the money supply. G-Secs yields are then found to rise.","Ess, Government securities market, yields, open market operations, debt inflows, price discovery, Monetary Management, Cost of Government Borrowing, Open market operations (OMOs)., All these keywords",https://ideas.repec.org/p/ess/wpaper/id13027.html,http://www.esocialsciences.org/Download/repecDownload.aspx?fname=A2019329141342_29.pdf&fcategory=Articles&AId=13027&fref=repec,RePEc:ess:wpaper:id:13027,"Ashima Goyal, 2019.

,India's Universal Basic Income: Bedeviled by the Details,Saksham Khosla,"The idea of a Universal Basic Income (UBI)-""”periodic and uncon- ditional cash payments to all citizens""”has gained renewed attention amid growing concerns about technological unemployment in advanced economies. More recently, economists have made the case for a UBI in the developing world, where cash transfers distributed to all citizens, rich and poor, may cut through layers of red tape and lead to outsize gains in poverty reduction. In India, a rapid expansion of direct cash transfers linked to the national biometric database and small basic income experiments have galvanized an extensive debate on a UBI. Supporters claim that no-strings-attached payments will be an effective antidote to India's underperforming antipoverty programs and leaky, distortionary subsidies. Critics worry that they will undermine an already-fragile social security architecture, cause workers to drop out of the labor force, and encourage wasteful spending.Rather than relying exclusively upon the survey's proposed methods for financing, targeting, and distributing a UBI, Indian policymakers should join their Finnish and Canadian counterparts in running one or several large-scale experimental evaluations. By determining the impact on both the government (state and fiscal capacity) and citizens (economic and social outcomes), such trials can generate new empirical evidence to inform the growing UBI debate and reveal the most effective role for unconditional transfers in India's welfare architecture.","UBI, Universal Basic Income, unconditional transfers, welfare architecture, anti-poverty programmes, social security architecture, All these keywords",https://ideas.repec.org/p/ess/wpaper/id13024.html,http://www.esocialsciences.org/Articles/show_Article.aspx?acat=InstitutionalPapers&aid=13024,RePEc:ess:wpaper:id:13024,"Saksham Khosla, 2019.

Recent efforts toward a revenue-based fiscal consolidation have started yielding improvements in the ratio of tax revenue to gross domestic product, and show promise in repairing the fiscal accounts. However, fiscal policy efforts need to be supported by reforms to generate nondebt-creating foreign currency inflows to stabilize the external sector and assist in building up a buffer stock of official foreign exchange reserves.","eSS, macroeconomics, deficits, macroeconomic performance, fiscal, tax revenue, gross domestic product, foreign currency, external sector, foreign exchange., All these keywords",https://ideas.repec.org/p/ess/wpaper/id13022.html,http://www.esocialsciences.org/Download/repecDownload.aspx?fname=A2019328135526_29.pdf&fcategory=Articles&AId=13022&fref=repec,RePEc:ess:wpaper:id:13022,"Dushni Weerakoon & Utsav Kumar & Roselle Dime, 2019.

,Sectoral amd Skill Contributions to Labor Productivity in Asia,"Matthias Helble, Long Q Trinh, Trang Le","Using a decomposition approach on data collected by the Asian Productivity Organization (APO) as well as World Input-Output data, it shows that in most Asian economies the services sector makes the largest contribution to labor productivity. Furthermore, it finds evidence of a major reallocation of labor from agriculture directly to services, bypassing the manufacturing sector. This finding challenges the traditional view that countries in their economic development need to have their workforce employed first in manufacturing before switching to services. Lastly, the paper studies how different skill levels contribute to labor productivity growth. It finds that high-skilled workers have contributed most to overall labor productivity growth in developing Asia. In services, high-skilled workers have mainly driven labor productivity, indicating that upskilling and training are instrumental in services-led development.","eSS, labor productivity, manufacturing, services, skills, All these keywords",https://ideas.repec.org/p/ess/wpaper/id13015.html,http://www.esocialsciences.org/Download/repecDownload.aspx?fname=A2019312151738_29.pdf&fcategory=Articles&AId=13015&fref=repec,RePEc:ess:wpaper:id:13015,"Matthias Helble & Long Q Trinh & Trang Le, 2019.

,Private Hospitals in Health Insurance Network in India: A Reflection for Implementation of Ayushman Bharat,"Mita Choudhury, Pritam Datta","This paper examines the availability and spread of private hospitals in the country to provide insights on the potential access to insured health services in GSHIS schemes. It uses three sets of information to analyse the issue: private hospitals empanelled by insurance companies, the 6th Economic Census, and private hospitals empanelled in GSHIS schemes in four States. The analysis suggests that, in low-income States of the country, empanelment of private hospitals by insurance companies is low and concentrated in a few pockets. This pattern closely corresponds to the pattern of availability of private hospitals indicated in the 6th Economic Census. In Andhra Pradesh, Telangana, Tamil Nadu and Karnataka, the four States which have some of the largest GSHIS schemes in the country, there is a strong correspondence between private hospitals empanelled by insurance companies and private hospitals empanelled in GSHIS schemes. In these States, the extent of empanelment of private hospitals in GSHIS schemes is also substantially smaller than the empanelment of private hospitals by insurance companies. This may indicate differences in entry conditions or low willingness of private hospitals to participate in GSHIS schemes.","eSS, : Private health providers, Private hospitals, Ayushman Bharat, Pradhan Mantri Jan Arogya Yojana, Access to health care, India, All these keywords",https://ideas.repec.org/p/ess/wpaper/id13009.html,http://www.esocialsciences.org/Download/repecDownload.aspx?fname=A201922018530_29.pdf&fcategory=Articles&AId=13009&fref=repec,RePEc:ess:wpaper:id:13009,"Mita Choudhury & Pritam Datta, 2019.

The shift from positive list to negative list has not resulted in any major increase in new exports. The share of new commodities exports in total exports has showed a rise of only 9 percentage points between 2012-13 and 2016-17. However, the trade basket has witnessed a diversification in terms of number of new items traded. The study finds that there is evidence of items shifting from informal to formal channels.

The study is based on the 68th round of NSS Employment and Unemployment Survey estimates. Using the over-education/required education/undereducation (ORU) models on a cross section dataset of individuals employed (as a regular salaried/ wage employee or as casual wage labour) in India's T&C industry, it finds that the overall educational mismatch ratio during 2011-12 was to the tune of 67.61%. Further, results indicate that while returns to surplus education is positive, it is less in magnitude as compared to returns to required education, suggesting underutilization of excess education.

,The Growing Importance of Consumer Finance for Financial Inclusion in India,"Saon Ray, Smita Miglani, Sandeep Paul","This paper examines the role of consumer finance, a high growth segment of the Indian financial sector in promoting financial inclusion. Consumer finance involves granting credit to consumers to enable them to possess goods for everyday use. While the Indian financial sector is changing rapidly, a large number of households still rely on informal sources for unforeseen expenditure. The paper presents results of a survey of consumer perception on the role of consumer credit to financial inclusion. Financial inclusion or access to financial services is a major development goal for all nations across the globe. The concept has a multitude of dimensions from payments and savings accounts, credit, insurance and pensions and securities market. Ensuring quality access to formal financial services has always been a challenging task. Despite being a prime policy agenda for decades, the goal of universal financial inclusion is yet to be achieved in India. The Indian financial inclusion story so far was led by commercial banks and MFIs. While acknowledging the importance of access to credit for productive purposes, a total integration with financial market also means access to services like insurance and consumption loans.","eSS, financial inclusion, NBFCs, consumer survey, financial sector, consumer finance, credit to consumers, expenditure, consumer perception, financial services, savings accounts, credit, insurance, pensions, securities market, formal financial services, universal financial inclusion, consumption loans, India., All these keywords",https://ideas.repec.org/p/ess/wpaper/id13000.html,http://www.esocialsciences.org/Download/repecDownload.aspx?fname=A20192313914_29.pdf&fcategory=Articles&AId=13000&fref=repec,RePEc:ess:wpaper:id:13000,"Saon Ray & Smita Miglani & Sandeep Paul, 2019.

,The Anomaly of Women's Work and Education in India,Surbhi Ghai,"This paper utilizes a large cross-section of data sets such as the ILOSTAT, NSSO Quinquennial Employment and Unemployment Survey, Labour Bureau Annual Employment and Unemployment Survey, National Family Health Survey and CMIE Consumer Pyramid Household Survey to comment on the falling female labour force participation rates in India. It is found that not only has there been a fall in the female labour force participation rates, but the size of the total female labour force has also shrunk in recent years. Besides presenting a series of demand and supply side factors that might possibly explain this trend, it aims to look at it particularly in conjunction with education and provide a commentary on the same. It is proposed that prevailing social norms and patriarchy hinders the participation of women in the economy despite high levels of education. Bivariate and multivariate analyses is conducted on state level cross-sectional data and it is found that patriarchy is indicative of the large proportion of women out of the labour force at high levels of education. It is concluded that education in the current form alone might not be sufficient to spur growth in female labour force participation rates in India. Government schemes must target the fundamental cultural and social forces that shape patriarchy. These coupled with policies that simultaneously address some of the other demand and supply side constraints will go a long way in bolstering the participation of women in the economy.","eSS, Female Labour Force Participation Rate, Education, Patriarchy, ILOSTAT, NSSO Quinquennial Employment and Unemployment Survey, Labour Bureau Annual Employment, Unemployment Survey, National Family Health Survey, CMIE Consumer Pyramid Household Survey, female labour force, labour force participation, female labour force participation rates, education, social norms, Government schemes, cultural forces, social forces, economy, India., All these keywords",https://ideas.repec.org/p/ess/wpaper/id12999.html,http://www.esocialsciences.org/Download/repecDownload.aspx?fname=A20192313030_29.pdf&fcategory=Articles&AId=12999&fref=repec,RePEc:ess:wpaper:id:12999,"Surbhi Ghai, 2019.

,Explaining the contractualisation of India's workforce,"Radhicka Kapoor, P. P. Krishnapriya","The employment structure of India's organised manufacturing sector has undergone substantial changes over the last decade with a steep rise in the use of contract workers in place of directly hired workers. Much of the existing literature has attributed the widespread use of contract labour to India's rigid employment protection legislation. Using plant level data from the Annual Survey of Industries, it finds that in addition to labour market rigidities and the existence of a wage differential between contract and directly hired workers, firms in the organised manufacturing sector have another important incentive to hire contract workers. Firms appear to be using contract workers to their strategic advantage against unionized directly hired workers to keep their bargaining power and wage demand in check. Importantly, the strength of this bargaining channel varies across firms depending on their capital intensity of production, size and existing contract worker intensity.","eSS, employment, wages, labour contracts, collective bargaining, labour productivity, employment structure, contract workers, hired workers, employment protection legislation, Annual Survey of Industries, labour market, wage differential, manufacturing sector, incentives, bargaining power, wage demand, bargaining channel, capital intensity of production, India., All these keywords",https://ideas.repec.org/p/ess/wpaper/id12998.html,http://www.esocialsciences.org/Download/repecDownload.aspx?fname=A201923125339_29.pdf&fcategory=Articles&AId=12998&fref=repec,RePEc:ess:wpaper:id:12998,"Radhicka Kapoor & P.

,Is There a Demand for Reverse Mortgages in China? Evidence from Two Online Surveys,"Katja Hanewald, Hazel Bateman, Hanming Fang, Shang Wu","Reverse mortgages provide an alternative source of retirement funding by allowing older homeowners to borrow against their home. However, a recent pilot program of reserve mortgage products in several large Chinese cities saw almost no take up. To ascertain the demand for reverse mortgages in China, a survey was conducted and analysed two online surveys that focus respectively on homeowners aged 45-65 as potential purchasers, and on adult children in the 20-49 age group representing children of potential purchasers. It addressed the reported shortcomings of the pilot reverse mortgage product by testing an improved product design presented in a clear and comprehensive format. In stark contrast, It was found that 89% of older Chinese homeowners would be interested in this new reverse mortgage product, and 84% of adult children would recommend such a product to their parents. Participants in both surveys reported that they would use the reverse mortgage payments to fund a more comfortable retirement and to pay for better medical treatments and aged care services. Respondents' interest in reverse mortgages was associated with their familiarity and understanding of the product, and its perceived potential to address liquidity constraints in retirement. Health status, aged care preferences and proxies for intergenerational links were also important. The results are contrary to the common perception of intergenerational expectations of wealth transfer in China, and provide new evidence in support of the potential development of China's reverse mortgage market.","eSS, demand, Reverse Mortgages, retirement funding, homeowners, borrow, reserve mortgage products, potential purchasers, mortgage payments, health status, aged care preferences, intergenerational expectations, wealth transfer, potential development, mortgage market, China., All these keywords",https://ideas.repec.org/p/ess/wpaper/id12997.html,http://www.esocialsciences.org/Download/repecDownload.aspx?fname=A201923124544_29.pdf&fcategory=Articles&AId=12997&fref=repec,RePEc:ess:wpaper:id:12997,"Katja Hanewald & Hazel Bateman & Hanming Fang & Shang Wu, 2019.

In presence of technology asymmetry, there will exist a clash of interest between the FTA members while the non-member will always prefer to join the bloc.

,Wage Inequalities in India,K.P. Kannan,This paper examines the dimension of inequality since our earlier work on poverty and deprivation suggest that social inequality seems to overwhelm all other inequalities in a whole range of indicators. The period of analysis is between 1993 and 2012. The findings suggest that overall wage inequality increased during the first decade (1993-2005) of economic reforms and declined somewhat during the next decade (2004-2012). More detailed work shows that the decline is mostly in the bottom half of the wage worker population.

,"Multi- Product Firms, Tariff Liberalization and Product Churning in Vietnamese Manufacturing",Ha Thi Thanh Doan,"This study documents the frequency and characteristics of multi-product firms in Vietnamese manufacturing. The major findings are as follows. First, multi-product firms are larger, more capital-intensive, more productive, and are more likely to export. Second, multi-product firms are active in the market. Approximately 60% of firms adjust their product scope within a 6-year period. Third, the contribution of firms' product extensive margin to aggregate output growth is limited due to the prevalence of product dropping, which offsets the positive impact of product adding. Most output growth during the period is thus generated by the intensive margin. Turning to the link between tariff reduction and product shedding, it does not detect any significant impact. However, it finds that exporters play an important role in product adding, which suggests that they may contribute to aggregate growth through the channeling of product scope expansion. Contrary to the expectations, the analysis offers limited support for the heterogeneity of product turnover across ownership types. While it finds that state-owned enterprises are more likely to spread economic activities across products and industries, there is little difference in terms of product churning amongst foreign direct investment, state-owned enterprises, and the domestic private sector.","eSS, multi-product firms, trade liberalization, tariff liberalization, manufacturing, capital- intensive, export, ownership, enterprises, economic activities, industries, foreign direct investment, state-owned enterprises, domestic private sector., All these keywords",https://ideas.repec.org/p/ess/wpaper/id12984.html,http://www.esocialsciences.org/Download/repecDownload.aspx?fname=A201912912517_29.pdf&fcategory=Articles&AId=12984&fref=repec,RePEc:ess:wpaper:id:12984,"Ha Thi Thanh Doan, 2019.

,Why is Green Finance Important ?,"Jeffrey D. Sachs, Wing Thye Woo, Naoyuki Yoshino, Farhad Taghizadeh-Hesary","In 2017, global investment in renewables and energy efficiency declined by 3% and there is a risk that it will slow further; clearly fossil fuels still dominate energy investment. This could threaten the expansion of green energy needed to provide energy security and meet climate and clean air goals. Several developed and developing economies are still following pro-coal energy policies and the extra CO2 generated by new coal-fired power plants could more than wipe out any reductions in emissions made by other nations. Finance is the engine of development of infrastructure projects, including energy projects. Generally financial institutions show more interest in fossil fuel projects than green projects, mainly because there are still several risks associated with these new technologies and they offer a lower rate of return. If they want to achieve sustainable development goals, they need to open a new file for green projects and scale up the financing of investments that provide environmental benefits, through new financial instruments and new policies, such as green bonds, green banks, carbon market instruments, fiscal policy, green central banking, financial technologies, community-based green funds, etc., which are collectively known as ""green finance"" .","eSS, green finance, renewable energy, CO2 emissions, Paris Agreement, sustainable development goals, SDGs, All these keywords",https://ideas.repec.org/p/ess/wpaper/id12983.html,http://www.esocialsciences.org/Download/repecDownload.aspx?fname=A2019128154737_29.pdf&fcategory=Articles&AId=12983&fref=repec,RePEc:ess:wpaper:id:12983,"Jeffrey D.

,How Does Public Debt Affect the Indian Macroeconomy? A Structural VAR Approach,"Ranjan Kumar Mohanty, Sidheswar Panda","This study investigates the macroeconomic effects of public debt in India using a Structural Vector Auto regression (SVAR) framework for the period from 1980 to 2017. The objective of this study is to examine the impact of several types of public debt on economic growth, investment, interest rate and inflation in India. The results of the Impulse response functions show that public debt has an adverse impact on economic growth, a positive impact on long-term interest rate and a mixed response (both negative and positive) on investment and inflation in India. It is also found that the domestic debt has a more adverse impact on the economy than external debt in India. The estimated variance decomposition analysis shows that much of the variations among selected macro variables are explained by public debt and growth in India. The study suggests that public debt, especially the domestic debt should be controlled and used in a more productive manner in order to have a favourable impact on the economy.","eSS, Public Debt, Internal Debt, External Debt, Economic Growth, Structural VAR Approach, Structural Vector Auto regression (SVAR), economic growth, interest rate, inflation, India, All these keywords",https://ideas.repec.org/p/ess/wpaper/id12980.html,http://www.esocialsciences.org/Download/repecDownload.aspx?fname=A201912315745_29.pdf&fcategory=Articles&AId=12980&fref=repec,RePEc:ess:wpaper:id:12980,"Ranjan Kumar Mohanty & Sidheswar Panda, 2019.

,Examining the Trade-Off Between Price and Financial Stability in India,"Ila Patnaik, Shalini Mittal, Radhika Pandey","In recent years, many emerging economies including India have adopted inflation targeting framework. Post the global financial crisis, there is a growing debate on whether monetary policy should target financial stability. Using India as a case study, it presents an empirical approach to assess whether monetary policy can target financial stability. This is done by examining the trade-off between price and financial stability for India. Using correlation between price and financial cycles, it finds that a trade-off exists between price and financial stability. The findings is robust to a series of robustness checks. The study has implications for the conduct of monetary policy in emerging economies.

,What do we Know about Changing Economic Activity of Firms?,"Radhika Pandey, Amey Sapre, Pramod Sinha","Identification of primary economic activity of Â¬firms is a prerequisite for compiling several macro aggregates. This paper takes a statistical approach to understand the extent of changes in primary economic activity of Â¬firms over time and across different industries. It uses the history of economic activity of over 46000 Â¬firms spread over 25 years from CMIE Prowess to identify the number of times Â¬firms change the nature of their business. Using the count of changes, it estimates Poisson and Negative Binomial regression models to gain predictability over changing economic activity across industry groups. The paper shows that a Poisson model accurately characterizes the distribution of count of changes across industries and that Â¬firms with a long history are more likely to have changed their primary economic activity over the years. Findings show that classification can be a crucial problem in a large dataset like the MCA21 and can even lead to distortions in value addition estimates at the industry level.","eSS, : Economic Activity, Manufacturing, India, Poisson Distribution, statistical approach, Poisson and Negative Binomial regression models, Poisson model, value addition, industry., All these keywords",https://ideas.repec.org/p/ess/wpaper/id12978.html,http://www.esocialsciences.org/Download/repecDownload.aspx?fname=A2019123145343_29.pdf&fcategory=Articles&AId=12978&fref=repec,RePEc:ess:wpaper:id:12978,"Radhika Pandey & Amey Sapre & Pramod Sinha, 2019.

,Responses to Trade Opening: Evidence and Lessons from Asia,Devashish Mitra,"In various Asian countries, international trade has raised productivity, lowered mark ups through import competition (while increasing them through cheaper inputs that can be imported), raised wages, expanded employment, and, above all, reduced poverty. This is in sharp contrast to the impact of trade in some of the Latin American countries, which suggests exercising caution in extrapolating results to Asian countries that have not yet been studied. There are also a few adverse consequences of trade that already been found for Asia. Apart from raising inequality, trade can increase informality, especially in the presence of labor-market rigidities. Additionally, there are the adverse effects stemming from trade adjustment as a result of worker mobility costs. In this context, this study discusses various policies that researchers have recommended.","eSS, trade, trade opening, international trade, productivity, import competition, employment, poverty, labor-market rigidities, worker mobility, costs, policies, Asian Countries, Asia., All these keywords",https://ideas.repec.org/p/ess/wpaper/id12977.html,http://www.esocialsciences.org/Download/repecDownload.aspx?fname=A201912214113_29.pdf&fcategory=Articles&AId=12977&fref=repec,RePEc:ess:wpaper:id:12977,"Devashish Mitra, 2019.

,Green Finance in Singapore: Barriers and Solutions,Youngho Chang,"This study reviews how green finance in Singapore is working, examines existing barriers, and suggests some solutions. Singapore, a well-established financial hub in Asia, aims to be a hub for green finance in Asia. The Monetary Authority of Singapore (MAS), the central bank of Singapore, has formed a network with seven other central banks in the world called the Central Banks and Supervisors Network for Greening Financial System, which intends to promote sharing of experience and best practices in green finance with other countries. Along with forming the network, the MAS has established a Green Bond Grant scheme to promote and ensure the issuance of green bonds in Singapore. In parallel, the Association of Banks in Singapore published Guidelines on Responsible Financing to promote and support environmental, social, and governance (ESG) disclosures. The Singapore Exchange asks its member firms to strictly comply with the ESG disclosures. At an individual firm level in Singapore, City Development Limited (CDL), a real estate development company, and Development Bank of Singapore Limited (DBS), a commercial bank, issued Singapore's first and second green bonds in 2017. The proceeds of the CDL green bond are allocated to finance retrofitting and upgrading of a commercial building in Singapore, while the proceeds of the DBS green bond are to be invested in renewable energy and climate change adaptation, among other uses.

,The Development of Education and Health Services in Asia and the Role of the State,Sudipto Mundle,"This paper analyses the dramatic spread of education and healthcare in Asia and also the large variations in that spread across and within countries over fifty years. Apart from differences in initial conditions and income levels, the nature of the State has also been an important determinant of these variations. This is because social development has typically been led by the State. But in most countries, public resource constraints and the growing dependence on private provision and private spending have generated a pattern of nested disparities in the access to education and healthcare between rich and poor regions, between rural and urban areas within regions, and between rich and poor households within these areas. However, as the better-off regions, areas, and households approach the upper limits of achievable education and health standards, a process of convergence is also underway as those left behind begin to catch up.","eSS, Asia, comparative studies, disparity, education, health, institutions, State, development of education, health services., All these keywords",https://ideas.repec.org/p/ess/wpaper/id12973.html,http://www.esocialsciences.org/Download/repecDownload.aspx?fname=A201911412458_29.pdf&fcategory=Articles&AId=12973&fref=repec,RePEc:ess:wpaper:id:12973,"Sudipto Mundle, 2019.

,Impact of Intergovernmental Fiscal Transfers on Gender Equality in India: An Empirical Analysis,"Janet G. Stotsky, Lekha Chakraborty, Piyush Gandhi","Intergovernmental fiscal transfers (IGFT) are, in theory, neither good nor bad for tackling gender inequalities. Fiscal federalism with asymmetry in revenue and expenditure assignments inevitably leads to vertical and horizontal imbalances in public service provisioning. Intergovernmental transfers can play a role in equalization of fiscal capacities because the states of India have different tax raising capacities and capacities for funding public expenditure. Do higher per capita fiscal transfers help in reducing gender inequalities across states in India? Using data from the Finance Accounts of various states, the paper analyses the impact of fiscal transfers - both conditional and unconditional fiscal transfers - on the gender parity index in education, using panel data models. It finds that unconditional transfers have a significant and positive impact on gender parity outcomes in the education sector at the primary and secondary levels, in contrast to tied transfers. The models also control for gender budgeting initiatives across states and find that gender budgeting has a beneficial effect on education equality. The policy implication of these results for the recently constituted Fifteenth Finance Commission in India is to strengthen the ""gender equality"" criteria in intergovernmental transfers in India.","eSS, Intergovernmental fiscal transfers (IGFT), gender inequalities, fiscal federalism, expenditure, public service, fiscal capacities, tax, public expenditure, per capita fiscal transfers, gender parity index, education, education sector, primary level, secondary level, gender budgeting, Fifteenth Finance Commission in India, India., All these keywords",https://ideas.repec.org/p/ess/wpaper/id12972.html,http://www.esocialsciences.org/Download/repecDownload.aspx?fname=A201911412422_29.pdf&fcategory=Articles&AId=12972&fref=repec,RePEc:ess:wpaper:id:12972,"Janet G.

,Exporting and Firm Performance: Evidence from India,"Apoorva Gupta, Ila Patnaik, Ajay Shah","In this paper the positive correlation between firm productivity and export status is well established. This correlation can arise from multiple alternative casual models. It has investigated these relationships, harnessing the transition of several firms from serving the domestic market to exporting, in a dataset of Indian firms from 1989 to 2015. Each firm which made the transition is matched against a control which did not. The transitions take place across many years, thus permitting a matched event study in firm outcomes. The paper finds there is self-selection of more productive firms into exporting. Firms that make the transition become bigger, but there is little evidence of learning by exporting, of improvements in productivity right after exporting commences. However, there is evidence of improvement in productivity of export starters a couple of years before they begin to export.","eSS, export, firms, firm productivity, export status, casual models, domestic markets, dataset, productive firms, domestic market, transition, India., All these keywords",https://ideas.repec.org/p/ess/wpaper/id12969.html,http://www.esocialsciences.org/Download/repecDownload.aspx?fname=A2019112121938_29.pdf&fcategory=Articles&AId=12969&fref=repec,RePEc:ess:wpaper:id:12969,"Apoorva Gupta & Ila Patnaik & Ajay Shah, 2019.

,UDAY Power Debt in Retrospect and Prospects: Analyzing the Efficiency Parameters,"Amandeep Kaur, Lekha Chakraborty","The Government of India launched the Ujwal DISCOM Assurance Yojana (UDAY), in November 2015, with an objective of ""Power for All"" . Under the UDAY scheme, selected States agreed to convert 75 per cent of the DISCOM's (State Power Distribution Companies) power debt into State government non-SLR bonds, priced at not more than 75 basis points above the prevailing cut-off yield rate of government security of 10-year maturity. At aggregate level, so far, around 86 per cent of UDAY bonds have been issued - Rs. 2.32 lakh crores out of Rs. 2.69 lakh crores - across all UDAY States/UTs. Our estimates reveal that the financial and operational efficiency parameters envisaged in UDAY tripartite MoUs - between DISCOMs, the State Governments and the Ministry of Power, Government of India - have not been met by many States. Using UDAY portal data, we find that the average AT&C (Aggregate Technical and Commercial) losses that should have been 15% for all the participating states by 2018-19, presently, on average, stand at 25.41%. Yet another financial indicator, ACS-ARR gap (the gap between Average Cost and Average Revenue) has also widened for many UDAY participating states. The power tariff revisions have also not been implemented in the States -due to political economy reasons - and the operational parameters in our analysis indicate widening inefficiencies across States in power infrastructure.","eSS, Power infrastructure, Power Debt, Bonds, Financial efficiency, Ujwal DISCOM Assurance Yojana (UDAY), DISCOM's (State Power Distribution Companies), power debt, government security, power infrastructure., All these keywords",https://ideas.repec.org/p/ess/wpaper/id12968.html,http://www.esocialsciences.org/Download/repecDownload.aspx?fname=A201911113728_29.pdf&fcategory=Articles&AId=12968&fref=repec,RePEc:ess:wpaper:id:12968,"Amandeep Kaur & Lekha Chakraborty, 2019.

,"Analyzing the Dynamic Relationship between Physical Infrastructure, Financial Development and Economic Growth in India","Ranjan Kumar Mohanty, N. R. Bhanumurthy","The paper investigates dynamic relationship between physical infrastructure, financial development and economic growth in the case of India, using an Autoregressive Distributed Lag (ARDL) and Toda-Yamamoto (T-Y) causality approach for the period 1980 to 2016. Physical infrastructure index and financial development index are constructed using Principal Component Analysis method. Empirical results suggest that physical infrastructure has a positive effect on economic growth both in the long-run and short-run, whereas financial development, though significant, has a weak impact on economic growth. The causality test supports a bi-directional causal relationship between infrastructure development and economic growth, while it finds a unidirectional causation running from economic growth to financial development. It also finds that gross investment and employment have a positive, and inflation has an adverse effect on economic growth. As India is aiming for higher growth for a sustained period, our results suggest that there is a need for Government intervention in expanding the physical infrastructure and this, in turn, could lead to the growth of the financial sector in the country.","eSS, financial sector, Infrastructure Index, Financial Development Index, Economic Growth, ARDL Approach, India, All these keywords",https://ideas.repec.org/p/ess/wpaper/id12967.html,http://www.esocialsciences.org/Download/repecDownload.aspx?fname=A201911112492_29.pdf&fcategory=Articles&AId=12967&fref=repec,RePEc:ess:wpaper:id:12967,"Ranjan Kumar Mohanty & N.

,Optimal Regulation of P2P Lending for Small and Medium-Sized Enterprises,"Naoko Nemoto, Bihong Huang, David Storey","This paper describes and evaluates the range of P2P lending systems on offer to small and medium-sized enterprises (SMEs) in several countries, considering different regulatory regimes. In some countries, there are problematic incentives for platforms that rate credit and originate loans without holding the risk of these loans. In addition, when investor returns are guaranteed by platforms, investors have no incentive to distinguish among risk categories. In several countries, notably the People's Republic of China, P2P platforms have engaged in fraudulent behavior and Ponzi-like schemes. On the other hand, stringent regulation in the United States has excessively impeded new entrants from providing competition to established platforms. Regulators should be mindful of these risks and others, while also seeking to capitalize on the benefits that the sector offers for providing new funding opportunities to SMEs. In our view, the United Kingdom can be suggested as an effective model to follow because of its tailor made and flexible regulation.","eSS, fintech, P2P lending, regulation, P2P lending system, small and medium-sized enterprises (SMEs), incentives, loans, credit, investors, People's Republic of China, P2P platform, Ponzi-like schemes, global trend., All these keywords",https://ideas.repec.org/p/ess/wpaper/id12964.html,http://www.esocialsciences.org/Download/repecDownload.aspx?fname=A201917142550_29.pdf&fcategory=Articles&AId=12964&fref=repec,RePEc:ess:wpaper:id:12964,"Naoko Nemoto & Bihong Huang & David Storey, 2019.
